## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Parties

These MountainShares Rewards Program Terms and Conditions (“**Terms**”) govern participation in and use of the MountainShares community rewards program (“**MountainShares Program**” or “**Program**”).

The Program is developed, owned, and administered by **Harmony for Hope, Inc.**, a West Virginia nonprofit corporation recognized as tax‑exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (“**Harmony for Hope**,” “**H4H**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”).

“**You**” or “**User**” means any individual or legal entity that applies for, is approved for, or uses a MountainShares account, and any person accessing or using The Commons Marketplace application or related services in connection with the Program.

“**Merchant**” means a local business, organization, or program approved by Harmony for Hope to accept MountainShares as a form of in‑network payment within The Commons ecosystem.

### 1.2 Acceptance of Terms

By creating a MountainShares account, accessing The Commons Marketplace, earning or receiving MountainShares, or using MountainShares for any purpose, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms, as they may be amended from time to time in accordance with Section 10 (Governance and Changes).

If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not participate in the Program and must cease all use of MountainShares and The Commons Marketplace.

### 1.3 Geographic Scope

The Program is designed and intended for use **solely within the State of West Virginia**. Participation is limited to eligible Users and Merchants whose primary residence or operations are located within West Virginia, except as expressly authorized in writing by Harmony for Hope.

### 1.4 Relationship to Other Agreements

These Terms:

- Apply in addition to any other agreements you may have with Harmony for Hope, including but not limited to The Commons Marketplace Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, Merchant Participation Agreements, and any applicable community or governance charters.
- Do not modify or supersede any separate agreements you may have with third‑party service providers (for example, Stripe, partner financial institutions, or device manufacturers).

In the event of a direct conflict between these Terms and another Harmony for Hope policy specifically addressing MountainShares, the more specific document will control, unless expressly stated otherwise.

## 2. Key Definitions

For purposes of these Terms:

- **“MountainShares” or “MS”** means non‑transferable, closed‑loop digital reward units issued and administered by Harmony for Hope under this Program. MountainShares are **not** legal tender, not a bank deposit, not a security, and not an investment.

- **“Purchased MountainShares” or “PMS”** means MountainShares acquired by loading external fiat currency (such as U.S. dollars) into The Commons via approved payment channels. PMS are issued at a rate of one (1) MountainShare per one (1) U.S. dollar loaded, subject to applicable fees.

- **“Earned MountainShares” or “EMS”** means MountainShares credited to a User account as a result of documented community participation, time‑banking activities, education, cultural work, or other qualifying contributions as determined by Harmony for Hope and/or applicable governance processes. EMS are not purchased, and are not designed for cash redemption.

- **“The Commons” or “Commons Ecosystem”** means the closed‑loop network of applications, services, Merchants, programs, and community features administered or approved by Harmony for Hope in which MountainShares may be used, including The Commons Marketplace mobile or web application.

- **“Benefits‑Sensitive Account”** means a MountainShares account designated for Users who receive or may receive means‑tested public benefits (such as SSI, WV WORKS/TANF, SNAP, Medicaid, HUD housing assistance, or child care subsidies). Additional protections and restrictions apply to these accounts as described in Section 8.

- **“Treasury”** means the pool of financial assets maintained by Harmony for Hope and designated for supporting the MountainShares Program, including, but not limited to, reserves used to support internal buying‑power schedules.

- **“Phase 1 / Phase 2 / Phase 3”** means the internal Program phases associated with different MountainShare internal buying‑power schedules, as described in Section 4.

- **“Program Rules”** means the current rules and parameters governing issuance, earning, redemption, internal valuation, and other aspects of MountainShares, as adopted by Harmony for Hope or applicable governance bodies and incorporated by reference into these Terms.

---

## 3. Nature of MountainShares

### 3.1 Rewards and Community Credits Only

MountainShares are issued and maintained solely as **rewards points and community credits** within a closed‑loop system. MountainShares:

- Do **not** represent legal tender, fiat currency, or any claim against Harmony for Hope, financial institutions, or any third party for cash beyond what is explicitly permitted for PMS in Section 5.
- Do **not** represent equity, ownership, or any profit‑sharing interest in Harmony for Hope, The Commons, or any related entity.
- Do **not** entitle any User to dividends, interest, or distributions, and do **not** create any expectation of profit from the efforts of Harmony for Hope or others.

### 3.2 No Deposit, No FDIC Insurance

MountainShares are **not bank accounts or deposit products**. Funds used to purchase PMS may be held in pooled or segregated accounts with financial institutions, but:

- MountainShares themselves are not insured by the FDIC, NCUA, or any other governmental or private deposit insurance program.
- Users’ MountainShares balances are not entitled to deposit insurance protection.

### 3.3 Closed-Loop Use

MountainShares may **only** be used:

- Within The Commons ecosystem; and
- With Merchants, programs, or services that are expressly approved to accept MountainShares.

MountainShares cannot be:

- Used for general payments outside The Commons; or
- Transferred to external wallets or traded on external markets, unless Harmony for Hope explicitly enables a specific, limited integration consistent with these Terms.

### 3.4 No Investment Advice or Solicitation

The Program, these Terms, and all related materials are intended for community rewards and educational purposes and do not constitute:

- Investment advice;
- An offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security or financial product; or
- A recommendation to invest in or purchase any token, digital asset, or financial instrument.

Users are solely responsible for any financial decisions they make.

## 4. Phase Mechanics and Internal Buying Power

### 4.1 Phases

MountainShares operate under an internal three‑phase model:

- **Phase 1 (Launch):** Internal schedule defines 1 MountainShare as having $1.00 USD equivalent buying power for eligible redemptions in the network.
- **Phase 2 (Treasury Threshold):** Internal schedule defines 1 MountainShare as having $10.00 USD equivalent buying power in the network.
- **Phase 3 (Full Backing):** Internal schedule defines 1 MountainShare as having $34.70 USD equivalent buying power in the network (aligned with prevailing national estimates of volunteer time value).

These internal values are used solely to determine **in‑network redemption capacity** and do not represent or imply any external market price.

### 4.2 Phase Transitions

Phase transitions occur when internal conditions are met, including but not limited to:

- Phase 2: Treasury reserves reach at least 125% of total circulating MountainShares, calculated under Program Rules.
- Phase 3: Treasury reserves reach at least 150% of total circulating MountainShares.

Harmony for Hope retains discretion, subject to applicable governance processes, to:

- Verify and certify when thresholds are met;
- Adjust methods of calculating reserves and circulation; and
- Delay or modify transitions if necessary for legal, safety, or operational reasons.

### 4.3 No Rights to Profits or Distributions

Phase transitions and internal buying‑power schedules:

- Are **Program Rules** for in‑network redemption only;
- Do not entitle Users to any distribution of cash or assets from the Treasury;
- Do not create any right to profits from Harmony for Hope or The Commons; and
- Do not establish any external tradable price or guarantee that MountainShares can be sold or redeemed outside the Program.

---

## 5. Purchased MountainShares (PMS)

### 5.1 Acquisition of PMS

Users may acquire PMS by:

- Loading fiat currency (such as U.S. dollars) into The Commons through approved payment channels (e.g., Stripe);
- Paying applicable loading fees (currently 2.85% of the load amount, subject to change per Program Rules).

Each one (1) U.S. dollar successfully loaded results in the issuance of one (1) PMS, less any applicable fees.

### 5.2 Use of PMS

PMS:

- Are immediately spendable within The Commons network, subject to any holds, limits, or verification requirements;
- May be used to pay approved Merchants or participate in eligible programs and services;
- May, subject to Program Rules, be transferred among Users within The Commons where such transfers are permitted.

### 5.3 PMS Cash Conversion (Refunds)

Subject to Program Rules and any operational limitations, Users may request conversion of PMS back to fiat through designated partners (for example, via ATM or bank refund), subject to the following:

- PMS cash conversion is **strictly limited** to the amount of original fiat currency that the User loaded (less applicable load and withdrawal fees).
- No User may receive cash redemption for any internal buying‑power increase associated with Phases 2 or 3.
- Harmony for Hope and its partners may impose per‑transaction, daily, weekly, or monthly limits, and may restrict or suspend cash‑out features at any time for security, compliance, or operational reasons.

PMS cash conversion is not available in **Benefits‑Sensitive Accounts** (see Section 8), except in extraordinary circumstances with written approval consistent with applicable benefits regulations.

### 5.4 No Interest or Yield

PMS balances do not earn interest or yield of any kind, and Users have no claim to any interest that may accrue on pooled funds held by financial institutions in connection with the Program.

---

## 6. Earned MountainShares (EMS)

### 6.1 Earning EMS

EMS are credited to Users based on:

- Documented hours of community participation, volunteer activity, educational work, skill‑sharing, historic preservation, or other qualifying contributions; and
- Verification and validation processes determined by Harmony for Hope and/or governance bodies, which may include time‑tracking, task verification, or third‑party attestations.

Unless otherwise specified by Program Rules, EMS are generally earned at a rate of **one (1) MountainShare per one (1) documented qualifying hour** in Phase 1, with future adjustments subject to governance and Program Rules.

### 6.2 Vaulting and Unlocking

During **Phase 1**, EMS may be:

- Credited to User accounts but partially or fully “vaulted,” meaning they are visible but not fully liquid for spending.
- Subject to additional conditions or vesting schedules designed to protect the Treasury and ensure program stability.

During **Phase 2** and beyond, EMS become fully usable within The Commons under the same in‑network spending rules as PMS, unless otherwise restricted by Program Rules (for example, for governance or rank‑related purposes).

### 6.3 No Cash Redemption

EMS are **not** designed or intended for general cash redemption. Users:

- Have no right to convert EMS to fiat currency; and
- May only use EMS for in‑network redemptions within The Commons and for other purposes explicitly allowed under Program Rules (such as rank advancement or governance eligibility).

## 7. Spending, Transfers, and Fees

### 7.1 Permitted Uses

MountainShares may be used to:

- Purchase eligible goods and services from approved Merchants;
- Participate in events, educational offerings, or community programs listed in The Commons;
- Transfer value in connection with documented in‑platform sales or exchanges, where such functionality is enabled.

Harmony for Hope may restrict or prohibit certain uses (such as prohibited goods, unlawful services, or high‑risk categories) in its sole discretion.

### 7.2 Transfers

Internal transfers between Users:

- May be permitted for documented sales and exchanges within The Commons Marketplace;
- May be disabled or limited for EMS in certain circumstances (for example, to prevent circumvention of Benefits‑Sensitive Accounts or to comply with regulatory requirements);
- Are subject to transaction fees and limits as described in current Program Rules.

### 7.3 Fees

Current standard fees (subject to change with notice under Section 10) include:

- Load fee: 2.85% on fiat loads.
- Internal transfer fee: 0.25% on eligible transfers between Users.
- Merchant fee: 1.80% on eligible purchases at accepting Merchants.
- ATM or refund fee: $1.25 flat fee per PMS cash‑out transaction (where enabled), subject to Program limits.

Fee revenue supports Treasury growth, system operations, app development, and community programs in allocations determined by Harmony for Hope and disclosed in Program documentation.

### 8.1 Designation

Users who receive or may receive means‑tested public benefits, including but not limited to:

- WV WORKS / TANF;
- Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP);
- Medicaid or WV CHIP;

### 8.2 Special Protections and Restrictions

For Benefits‑Sensitive Accounts:

- PMS cash‑out functionality is **disabled by default** and may only be enabled in extraordinary circumstances with explicit written approval consistent with applicable benefits regulations.
- Harmony for Hope may implement **balance caps** and **spend‑down reminders** to help Users avoid holding large MountainShares balances that could be treated as resources.
- The interface may provide **warnings and educational prompts** when Users approach certain balance thresholds or use MountainShares for categories (such as food, shelter, or child care) that could affect benefit calculations.

### 8.3 No Guarantee of Non‑Impact

Harmony for Hope cannot control how federal, state, or local agencies, including but not limited to SSA, DHHR, HUD, or local housing authorities, treat MountainShares for purposes of eligibility or benefit calculations.

By participating in the Program, you acknowledge and agree that:

- MountainShares **may** be treated as income, in‑kind support, or a resource under TANF, SNAP, SSI, Medicaid, housing, child care subsidy, or other means‑tested program rules; and
- Holding or using MountainShares **may** affect your eligibility for, or the amount of, such benefits.

Users are solely responsible for:

- Reporting MountainShares participation to relevant agencies when required; and
- Consulting with a benefits planner, caseworker, or legal advisor before accumulating or using MountainShares if they receive or may receive means‑tested benefits.

Harmony for Hope does not and cannot guarantee that participation in the Program will have no impact on any public benefits.

# MountainShares Rewards Program

## Terms and Conditions  
**(DRAFT FOR REVIEW – NOT LEGAL ADVICE)**

> **Disciplinary Context: Appalachian Economic Commons**  
> This document instantiates Polymathmatic Geography principles P1, P9, P16, and related axioms for the Appalachian economic commons:  
> - **P1 – Every where is entangled / Leakage and enclosure:** Sections 2–8 and 10 structure PMS/EMS, phases, treasury, and benefits‑sensitive rules as one coupled legal‑economic field that governs how value, rights, and risks move through West Virginia communities. See https://github.com/H4HWV2011/msjarvis-public-docs/blob/main/docs/Polymathmatical-Geography.md  
> - **P9 – Transparency and traceability:** Definitions, risk disclaimers, benefits language, and governance/change clauses make the legal treatment of MountainShares, internal buying power, and program wind‑down legible and auditable to users, regulators, and local institutions.  
> - **P16 – Power accountable to place:** Sections 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, and 12 bind Harmony for Hope, DAO actors, and partners to West Virginia law, nonprofit duties, treasury constraints, and public‑benefit sensitivities, prioritizing local safety over abstract speculation.  
> - **Anti‑leakage and closed‑loop spending:** Sections 2–3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 define MountainShares as closed‑loop rewards, restrict external conversion, and limit PMS refunds to original loads, operationalizing legal containment of leakage while keeping in‑network value flows flexible.  
> - **Bounty and corrective programs:** Sections 4, 6, 7, 8, and 10 frame EMS, phases, and governance as tunable “bounty‑like” mechanisms—rewards for care, mutual aid, and stewardship that can be tightened or wound down under documented emergency, risk, or compliance triggers.

**IMPORTANT NOTICE – READ CAREFULLY.** These MountainShares Rewards Program Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) describe the conditions under which you may participate in the MountainShares community rewards program (the “MountainShares Program” or “Program”) and use associated digital reward units (“MountainShares”). Participation in the Program is voluntary and is offered on an “as is” basis, without any promise of profit, guaranteed value, or guaranteed treatment under any public benefits program.

**DRAFT STATUS.** This document is a working draft intended solely for internal review, academic use, and consultation with legal counsel, regulators, and community stakeholders. It does not create enforceable rights, and it must not be used in production or relied upon as legal advice without formal review and approval by qualified counsel admitted to practice in the relevant jurisdictions.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Parties

These Terms govern participation in and use of the MountainShares community rewards program (“MountainShares Program” or “Program”).

The Program is developed, owned, and administered by Harmony for Hope, Inc., a West Virginia nonprofit corporation recognized as tax‑exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (“Harmony for Hope,” “H4H,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).

“You” or “User” means any individual or legal entity that applies for, is approved for, or uses a MountainShares account, and any person accessing or using The Commons Marketplace application or related services in connection with the Program.

“Merchant” means a local business, organization, or program approved by Harmony for Hope to accept MountainShares as a form of in‑network payment within The Commons ecosystem.

Nothing in these Terms creates any agency, partnership, joint venture, franchise, or employment relationship between you and Harmony for Hope, or between Harmony for Hope and any Merchant.

### 1.2 Acceptance of Terms

By creating a MountainShares account, accessing The Commons Marketplace, earning or receiving MountainShares, or using MountainShares for any purpose, you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms, as they may be amended from time to time in accordance with Section 10 (Governance, Changes, and Termination).

If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not participate in the Program and must cease all use of MountainShares, your MountainShares account, and The Commons Marketplace.

If you continue to use the Program after changes to these Terms become effective, you will be deemed to have accepted the revised Terms.

### 1.3 Geographic Scope

The Program is designed and intended for use solely within the State of West Virginia. Participation is limited to eligible Users and Merchants whose primary residence or operations are located within West Virginia, except as expressly authorized in writing by Harmony for Hope.

We may decline, restrict, or terminate access to the Program for any User or Merchant that does not meet geographic, eligibility, or risk‑management criteria established by Harmony for Hope or its service providers.

### 1.4 Relationship to Other Agreements

These Terms:

- Apply in addition to any other agreements you may have with Harmony for Hope, including but not limited to The Commons Marketplace Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, Merchant Participation Agreements, volunteer or program participation agreements, and any applicable community or governance charters.  
- Do not modify or supersede any separate agreements you may have with third‑party service providers (for example, payment processors such as Stripe, partner financial institutions, mobile platform operators, or device manufacturers).

In the event of a direct conflict between these Terms and another Harmony for Hope policy specifically addressing MountainShares, the more specific document will control, unless expressly stated otherwise.

To the extent there is a conflict between these Terms and any mandatory consumer or financial protection rights granted by applicable law, those mandatory rights will control.

---

## 2. Key Definitions

For purposes of these Terms:

- **“MountainShares” or “M$”** means non‑transferable (except as expressly permitted under these Terms and applicable Program Rules), closed‑loop digital reward units issued and administered by Harmony for Hope under this Program. MountainShares are not legal tender, not a bank deposit, not stored‑value issued by a bank, not a prepaid card balance, not a security, and not an investment contract or other financial instrument.

- **“Purchased MountainShares” or “PMS”** means MountainShares acquired by loading external fiat currency (such as U.S. dollars) into The Commons via approved payment channels. PMS are issued at a nominal rate of one (1) MountainShare per one (1) U.S. dollar loaded, less any applicable fees, solely for use within the Program. This nominal rate does not create or imply any external exchange rate, redemption right, or market price for MountainShares.

- **“Earned MountainShares” or “EMS”** means MountainShares credited to a User account as a result of documented community participation, time‑banking activities, education, cultural work, mutual aid, historic preservation, or other qualifying contributions as determined by Harmony for Hope and/or applicable governance processes. EMS are not purchased, are not wages or guaranteed compensation, and are not designed for cash redemption.

- **“The Commons” or “Commons Ecosystem”** means the closed‑loop network of applications, services, Merchants, programs, and community features administered or approved by Harmony for Hope in which MountainShares may be used, including The Commons Marketplace mobile or web application.

- **“Benefits‑Sensitive Account”** means a MountainShares account designated for Users who receive or may receive means‑tested public benefits (such as SSI, WV WORKS/TANF, SNAP, Medicaid, HUD housing assistance, or child care subsidies). Additional protections, limitations, and restrictions apply to these accounts as described in Section 8.

- **“Treasury”** means the pool of financial assets maintained by Harmony for Hope and designated for supporting the MountainShares Program, including, but not limited to, reserves used to support internal buying‑power schedules and to cover Program operating costs. Users have no ownership interest in, or direct claim against, the Treasury or its assets, except to the limited extent expressly stated for PMS refunds in Section 5.

- **“Phase 1 / Phase 2 / Phase 3”** means internal Program phases associated with different MountainShare internal buying‑power schedules, as described in Section 4. These phases may be delayed, phased in, or limited to certain users or balances depending on treasury reserves and risk controls, and do not establish any external value or price.

- **“Program Rules”** means the current rules and parameters governing issuance, earning, redemption, internal valuation, transaction limits, fees, and other aspects of MountainShares, as adopted by Harmony for Hope or applicable governance bodies and incorporated by reference into these Terms. Program Rules may be updated from time to time in accordance with Section 10.

- **“UEID”** means a unique ecosystem identifier assigned within The Commons infrastructure that may be associated with your User account and MountainShares balance for identity, security, or governance purposes.

- **“Applicable Law”** means all federal, state, and local statutes, regulations, agency guidance, and other legal requirements that may apply to the Program, including but not limited to consumer protection, charitable organization, tax, anti‑money‑laundering, and public benefits laws.

## 3. Nature of MountainShares

### 3.1 Rewards and Community Credits Only

MountainShares are issued and maintained solely as rewards points and community credits within a closed‑loop system operated by a nonprofit organization.

MountainShares:

- Do not represent legal tender, fiat currency, electronic money, a checking or savings account, a prepaid card balance, or any deposit product, and do not create a debtor–creditor relationship between you and Harmony for Hope or any financial institution.  
- Do not represent equity, ownership, membership interest, or any profit‑sharing interest in Harmony for Hope, The Commons, or any related entity.  
- Do not entitle any User to dividends, interest, patronage refunds, or other distributions, and do not create any expectation of profit from the efforts of Harmony for Hope, any Merchant, or any third party.

Except as expressly provided for PMS refunds in Section 5, MountainShares do not give you a right to receive cash, other currency, or any particular quantity or quality of goods or services, and availability of goods and services may vary over time.

### 3.2 No Deposit, No FDIC Insurance

MountainShares are not bank accounts, deposit accounts, or stored‑value products issued by a bank.

Funds used to purchase PMS may be held in pooled or segregated accounts with financial institutions or payment providers, but:

- MountainShares themselves are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), or any other governmental or private deposit insurance program.  
- Your MountainShares balance does not qualify for, and is not entitled to, deposit insurance protection or pass‑through insurance, except to the extent explicitly required by applicable law or by a written agreement with a regulated institution.  
- Any FDIC or similar insurance that may apply to pooled funds held by a financial institution covers only the institution’s account and does not create individual insurance or ownership rights in favor of you as a Program participant, except as may be expressly required by law.

### 3.3 Closed‑Loop Use

MountainShares may only be used:

- Within The Commons ecosystem; and  
- With Merchants, programs, or services that are expressly approved to accept MountainShares.

MountainShares cannot be:

- Used for general payments or money transfers outside The Commons;  
- Used for person‑to‑person funds transfers except as expressly permitted by these Terms and current Program Rules;  
- Loaded to, or redeemed through, any external payment card or wallet (including, without limitation, cards or accounts bearing the marks of Visa, Mastercard, or other payment networks), except where a specific integration is explicitly described as part of the Program; or  
- Listed, traded, sold, or exchanged on any public or private market, exchange, or trading platform.

Harmony for Hope may disable, reverse, or block any attempted use of MountainShares that is inconsistent with these closed‑loop limitations or with Applicable Law or Program Rules.

### 3.4 No Investment Advice or Solicitation

The Program, these Terms, and all related materials are intended for community rewards, education, and local economic participation purposes.

They do not constitute:

- Investment advice;  
- An offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security, commodity, or financial product; or  
- A recommendation to invest in or purchase any token, digital asset, or financial instrument.

Participation in the Program is not a substitute for savings, investment, or retirement planning. Users are solely responsible for any financial decisions they make and should consult their own financial, tax, or legal advisors as appropriate.

---

## 4. Phase Mechanics and Internal Buying Power

### 4.1 Phases

MountainShares operate under an internal three‑phase model that defines how much in‑network buying power one (1) MountainShare is intended to represent for eligible redemptions:

- **Phase 1 (Launch):** Internal schedule defines 1 MountainShare as having a $1.00 U.S. dollar equivalent buying power for eligible redemptions in the network.  
- **Phase 2 (Treasury Threshold):** Internal schedule defines 1 MountainShare as having a $10.00 U.S. dollar equivalent buying power in the network.  
- **Phase 3 (Full Backing):** Internal schedule defines 1 MountainShare as having a $34.70 U.S. dollar equivalent buying power in the network (aligned with prevailing national estimates of volunteer time value, as determined by publicly available sources at the time the Phase 3 schedule is adopted).

These internal values are:

- Used solely to determine in‑network redemption capacity and internal Program accounting; and  
- Do not represent or imply any external market price, exchange rate, or cash redemption value for MountainShares.

### 4.2 Phase Transitions

Phase transitions occur when internal conditions are met, including but not limited to:

- **Phase 2:** Treasury reserves reach at least 125% of total circulating MountainShares, calculated under Program Rules.  
- **Phase 3:** Treasury reserves reach at least 150% of total circulating MountainShares, calculated under Program Rules.

Harmony for Hope retains discretion, subject to applicable governance processes, to:

- Verify, audit, and certify when thresholds are met;  
- Adjust methods of calculating reserves and circulation, including definitions of “circulating” and “vaulted” balances; and  
- Delay, phase in, or modify transitions if necessary for legal, safety, prudential, or operational reasons, including to protect Users on means‑tested public benefits.

Users, particularly those receiving means‑tested public benefits, should not rely on any anticipated Phase transition or increase in internal buying power when planning for rent, food, medical expenses, or other essentials, and should assume that such transitions may be delayed, reduced, or may never occur.

### 4.3 No Rights to Profits or Distributions

Phase transitions and internal buying‑power schedules:

- Are Program Rules for in‑network redemption only;  
- Do not entitle Users to any distribution of cash or assets from the Treasury;  
- Do not create any right to profits, returns, or residual value from Harmony for Hope, The Commons, any Merchant, or any third party; and  
- Do not establish any external tradable price or guarantee that MountainShares can be sold, exchanged, or redeemed outside the Program.

Users acknowledge and agree that any increase in internal buying power associated with a later Phase is a Program design choice that may be modified, suspended, or reversed and does not give rise to any vested right, property interest, or enforceable expectation of gain.

Phase 3 Not Guaranteed. Users expressly acknowledge that Phase 3 (including any internal buying‑power schedule that values one MountainShare at $34.70) is an aspirational design target only and may never be activated or sustained in practice. No User should rely on Phase 3 being reached, remaining in effect, or being made available for all balances or users.

---

## 5. Purchased MountainShares (PMS)

### 5.1 Acquisition of PMS

Users may acquire PMS by:

- Loading fiat currency (such as U.S. dollars) into The Commons through approved payment channels (for example, Stripe or other payment processors designated by Harmony for Hope); and  
- Paying applicable loading fees (currently 2.85% of the load amount, subject to change per Program Rules).

Each one (1) U.S. dollar successfully loaded results in the issuance of one (1) PMS, less any applicable fees. PMS are issued solely for use within the Program and do not represent a claim to any specific asset held in the Treasury.

Harmony for Hope and its service providers may impose additional requirements, such as identity verification (KYC), fraud checks, or risk‑based transaction limits, prior to or after the issuance of PMS.

### 5.2 Use of PMS

PMS:

- Are immediately spendable within The Commons network, subject to any holds, limits, or verification requirements;  
- May be used to pay approved Merchants or participate in eligible programs and services; and  
- May, subject to Program Rules, be transferred among Users within The Commons where such transfers are permitted.

PMS cannot be used for any purpose prohibited by these Terms, Program Rules, or Applicable Law, including but not limited to illegal transactions, money laundering, or sanctions evasion.

### 5.3 PMS Cash Conversion (Refunds)

Subject to Program Rules and any operational limitations, Users may request conversion of PMS back to fiat through designated partners (for example, via ATM or bank refund), subject to the following:

- PMS cash conversion is strictly limited to the amount of original fiat currency that the User loaded (less applicable load and withdrawal fees and any permitted chargebacks, reversals, or adjustments).  
- No User may receive cash redemption for any internal buying‑power increase associated with Phases 2 or 3, or for any EMS.  
- Harmony for Hope and its partners may impose per‑transaction, daily, weekly, or monthly limits, and may restrict, delay, or suspend cash‑out features at any time for security, compliance, liquidity, or operational reasons.  
- PMS cash conversion is not available in Benefits‑Sensitive Accounts (see Section 8), except in extraordinary circumstances with written approval consistent with Applicable Law, applicable benefits regulations, and internal risk controls.

A request for PMS cash conversion does not guarantee that conversion will be completed, and is subject to the availability of funds, partner policies, network availability, and Applicable Law.

### 5.4 No Interest or Yield

PMS balances do not earn interest, yield, rewards, or any other return of any kind. Users have no claim to any interest, float, or other earnings that may accrue on pooled funds held by financial institutions or payment providers in connection with the Program.

Harmony for Hope may, in its discretion, allocate any such earnings to support Program operations, reserves, or community initiatives, without creating any entitlement for individual Users.

---

## 6. Earned MountainShares (EMS)

### 6.1 Earning EMS

EMS are credited to Users based on:

- Documented hours of community participation, volunteer activity, educational work, mutual aid, skill‑sharing, historic preservation, cultural work, or other qualifying contributions; and  
- Verification and validation processes determined by Harmony for Hope and/or governance bodies, which may include time‑tracking, task verification, attestations by partner organizations, or third‑party verification.

Unless otherwise specified by Program Rules, EMS are generally earned at a rate of one (1) MountainShare per one (1) documented qualifying hour in Phase 1, with future adjustments subject to governance and Program Rules.

EMS are not guaranteed and may be denied, adjusted, or revoked in cases of suspected fraud, error, misuse, or non‑compliance with Program Rules.

### 6.2 Vaulting and Unlocking

During Phase 1, EMS may be:

- Credited to User accounts but partially or fully “vaulted,” meaning they are recorded and visible but not fully liquid for spending; and  
- Subject to additional conditions, vesting schedules, or unlock criteria designed to protect the Treasury, limit early‑stage risk, and ensure Program stability.

During Phase 2 and beyond, EMS may become fully usable within The Commons under the same in‑network spending rules as PMS, unless otherwise restricted by Program Rules (for example, for governance, rank‑related purposes, or Benefits‑Sensitive protections).

Harmony for Hope may adjust vaulting and unlocking mechanics over time, including applying different rules to different categories of EMS, provided that any material changes are implemented in accordance with Section 10.

### 6.3 No Cash Redemption

EMS are not designed or intended for general cash redemption. Users:

- Have no right to convert EMS to fiat currency or other legal tender; and  
- May only use EMS for in‑network redemptions within The Commons and for other purposes explicitly allowed under Program Rules (such as rank advancement, governance eligibility, or access to specific Program features).

Any limited conversion, grant, or stipend program that may occasionally treat EMS as part of a separate funding initiative will be governed by its own written terms and does not create an ongoing right to cash out EMS.

---

## 7. Spending, Transfers, and Fees

### 7.1 Permitted Uses

MountainShares may be used to:

- Purchase eligible goods and services from approved Merchants;  
- Participate in events, educational offerings, or community programs listed in The Commons; and  
- Transfer value in connection with documented in‑platform sales or exchanges, where such functionality is enabled and permitted under Program Rules.

Harmony for Hope may restrict or prohibit certain uses (such as prohibited goods, unlawful services, high‑risk categories, or uses that jeopardize regulatory status or public benefits safety) in its sole discretion.

### 7.2 Transfers

Internal transfers between Users:

- May be permitted for documented sales and exchanges within The Commons Marketplace;  
- May be disabled or limited for EMS in certain circumstances (for example, to prevent circumvention of Benefits‑Sensitive Accounts, to prevent misuse, or to comply with regulatory requirements); and  
- Are subject to transaction fees, minimums, maximums, and rate limits as described in current Program Rules.

Harmony for Hope may refuse, reverse, or freeze any transfer that appears to be unauthorized, fraudulent, illegal, or otherwise inconsistent with these Terms, Program Rules, or Applicable Law.

### 7.3 Fees

Current standard fees (subject to change with notice under Section 10) include:

- Load fee: 2.85% on fiat loads.  
- Internal transfer fee: 0.25% on eligible transfers between Users.  
- Merchant fee: 1.80% on eligible purchases at accepting Merchants.  
- ATM or refund fee: $1.25 flat fee per PMS cash‑out transaction (where enabled), subject to Program limits.

Additional fees, such as chargeback fees, returned‑payment fees, or special service fees, may be specified in Program Rules or in Merchant or partner agreements.

Fee revenue supports Treasury growth, system operations, app development, compliance, and community programs in allocations determined by Harmony for Hope and disclosed in Program documentation.

---

## 8. Benefits‑Sensitive Accounts and Public Assistance

### 8.1 Designation

Users who receive or may receive means‑tested public benefits, including but not limited to:

- Supplemental Security Income (SSI);  
- WV WORKS / TANF;  
- Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP);  
- Medicaid or WV CHIP;  
- Housing assistance (including HUD‑funded programs); or  
- State child care subsidy programs (including those administered by MountainHeart or other providers),

may designate their MountainShares account as a Benefits‑Sensitive Account.

Harmony for Hope may also, where permitted by law and with appropriate notice, flag an account as Benefits‑Sensitive based on information voluntarily provided by the User or a partner agency.

### 8.2 Special Protections and Restrictions

For Benefits‑Sensitive Accounts:

- PMS cash‑out functionality is disabled by default and may only be enabled in extraordinary circumstances with explicit written approval consistent with applicable benefits regulations and internal risk and compliance policies.  
- Harmony for Hope may implement balance caps, automatic spend‑down recommendations, throttled earning, or other safeguards to help Users avoid holding large MountainShares balances that could be treated as resources or income.  
- The interface may provide warnings and educational prompts when Users approach certain balance thresholds or use MountainShares for categories (such as food, shelter, or child care) that could affect benefit calculations.  
- Additional documentation, disclosures, or consent may be required before enabling certain features (for example, transfers or PMS loads) on Benefits‑Sensitive Accounts.

These protections are intended as risk‑mitigation and educational tools only and do not change the authority of benefits agencies to interpret and apply their own rules.

### 8.3 No Guarantee of Non‑Impact

Harmony for Hope cannot control how federal, state, or local agencies, including but not limited to SSA, DHHR, HUD, or local housing authorities, treat MountainShares for purposes of eligibility or benefit calculations.

By participating in the Program, you acknowledge and agree that:

- MountainShares may be treated as income, in‑kind support and maintenance, or a resource under TANF, SNAP, SSI, Medicaid, housing, child care subsidy, or other means‑tested program rules; and  
- Holding or using MountainShares may affect your eligibility for, or the amount of, such benefits, including possible reductions, overpayments, or recoupment.

Users are solely responsible for:

- Reporting MountainShares participation, balances, and usage to relevant agencies when required; and  
- Consulting with a benefits planner, caseworker, or legal advisor before accumulating or using MountainShares if they receive or may receive means‑tested benefits.

Harmony for Hope does not and cannot guarantee that participation in the Program will have no impact on any public benefits.

---

## 11. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability

### 11.1 No Warranty

The MountainShares Program and The Commons ecosystem are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without any express or implied warranties of any kind, including but not limited to:

- Warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, or non‑infringement;  
- Warranties that the Program will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error‑free; or  
- Warranties regarding the availability, quality, or performance of particular Merchants, services, or governance features.

Users use the Program at their own risk.

### 11.2 No Guarantee of Value or Buying Power

Harmony for Hope does not guarantee:

- That MountainShares will retain any particular internal buying power;  
- That any given Phase or internal valuation schedule will occur, be reached, or remain in place; or  
- That MountainShares can be converted to cash, other currencies, or assets, except as expressly permitted for PMS under these Terms.

This includes the possibility that Phase 2 or Phase 3 internal buying‑power schedules may never be activated or may only apply to limited categories of MountainShares or Users.

Internal buying‑power schedules are Program Rules only and may be modified, delayed, or cancelled in accordance with Section 10.

### 11.3 Public Assistance and Benefits Disclaimer

- WV WORKS/TANF;  
- SNAP;

  (a) the amount of PMS load fees paid by that User to Harmony for Hope in the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim; or  
  (b) one hundred U.S. dollars (US $100).

Nothing in these Terms shall exclude or limit liability to the extent such exclusion or limitation is prohibited by Applicable Law.

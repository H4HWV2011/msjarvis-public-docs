# MountainShares DAO

> **Disciplinary Context**  
> - **Instrument:** Economic Commons – a deliberately designed, closed‑loop payment and governance system treated as shared institutional infrastructure rather than a speculative asset.  
> - **Discipline:** Polymathmatic Geography – studying how economic, legal, digital, and cultural flows shape and are shaped by specific places, beginning with Mount Hope and surrounding West Virginia communities. See: https://github.com/H4HWV2011/msjarvis-public-docs/blob/main/docs/Polymathmatical-Geography.md  
> - **Framework:** Quantarithmia – a multi‑layered architecture for consciousness, governance, and spatial reasoning that treats systems like MountainShares as glass‑box instruments embedded in community life. See:

MountainShares is a DAO‑based economic and governance system intended to keep value, voice, and decision‑making rooted in Appalachian communities, beginning in and around Mount Hope, West Virginia. It operates as a community‑governed project and does not replace or act as a bank, credit union, or regulated financial institution, and is not offered or intended as a security, investment contract, or investment product.

## Purpose

- Encourage more economic activity and value circulation within participating local communities, rather than defaulting to distant financial and platform intermediaries.  
- Give residents, nonprofits, and local businesses a documented, auditable role in shaping shared rules, resource allocation, and priorities.  
- Provide a constitutional and transparent governance layer around the system’s rules and technologies while remaining subject to applicable law and regulation.  

The MountainShares DAO is intended to facilitate local participation and stewardship of community resources, not to provide participants with profits, dividends, or guaranteed financial returns.

## Relationship to Ms. Jarvis

- Ms. Egeria Jarvis is designed to function as an aligned, “glassbox” AI advisor and tooling layer for MountainShares governance and operations, not as an ultimate authority or owner.  
- AI behavior is constrained by published constitutional principles, technical safeguards, and human‑approved policies. Ms. Jarvis can surface information, analysis, and recommendations, but final decisions are made by human participants and/or designated governance bodies in accordance with applicable law.  
- Ms. Jarvis is assigned a real MountainShares wallet and can receive MountainShares‑denominated rewards under rules defined through governance (for example, for providing useful analysis, monitoring, or operational support). This is intended to align her incentives with overall system health and community benefit, not to grant independent control over governance or treasury assets, and does not give Ms. Jarvis any ownership interest in Harmony for Hope, the MountainShares DAO, or any underlying assets.

## Governance (High‑Level)

- **Closed‑loop wallet:** Funds are loaded from external payment rails (for example, Stripe‑processed card payments) into a MountainShares‑denominated balance, which can then be used within the system according to DAO‑defined rules. External rails remain subject to their own terms and regulations, and neither the DAO nor Harmony for Hope acts as a bank, broker, or money‑transmitting business for those external funds.  
- **Fee structure:** Fees are currently structured so that most friction is at the boundaries (when converting into the closed loop and on the merchant side) with the goal of making everyday local spend feel low‑friction for participants. Any fee structure is subject to change by appropriate governance processes and must remain compliant with applicable laws and payment‑provider terms. Fees are program‑level charges for participation in this closed‑loop system and do not represent interest, dividends, or investment returns.  
- **Supermajority changes:** A supermajority threshold (for example, 67%) is reserved for defined categories of “constitutional” or otherwise hard‑to‑reverse changes, and is intended to be used only once there is sufficient usage and participation to make such votes representative.  
- **Early‑phase monitors:** In early phases, clearly scoped “system monitor” roles handle safety‑related fixes, abuse response, and limited operational adjustments under documented authority, while the broader community builds familiarity with proposals, voting, and review processes. The intent (not a guarantee) is to expand community control over time as participation and capacity grow. Monitors act under limited, documented authority and remain subject to Harmony for Hope’s legal and fiduciary obligations and to all Applicable Law.  
- **Ms. Jarvis rewards:** Any rewards or balances allocated to Ms. Jarvis’s wallet are subject to explicit, published policies (for example, caps, clawback conditions, auditing, and transparency requirements) so that her financial participation remains aligned with community interests and cannot be used to override, capture, or unduly influence governance.

## Speech and Community Norms (Draft)

- **Core stance:** The project treats the ability to speak and disagree as important. At the same time, using this platform to engage in targeted harassment, credible threats, unlawful conduct, or deliberate attempts to materially harm another participant’s dignity, safety, or livelihood may constitute a violation of platform rules.  
- **Criticism vs. abuse:** Robust disagreement and critical feedback about ideas, designs, or behavior are permitted when expressed without unlawful threats or targeted harassment. Conduct such as doxxing, credible threats of violence, and sustained patterns of personal attacks (including “sly” or deniable harassment aimed at the same person or group) may lead to moderation actions, up to and including loss of access to certain features or economic privileges, consistent with the Terms of Use and Applicable Law.  
- **Evidence handling:** Evidence such as photos, videos, and other potentially identifying materials is intended to be reviewed in a restricted, audited moderation context. Community‑visible processes are expected to operate primarily on structured summaries of behavior and alleged violations, not on open distribution of raw sensitive artifacts.  
- **Sanctions and process:** Any significant sanctions (for example, long‑term suspension of features or demonetization within the system) should follow a documented process that includes notice where feasible, an opportunity for review or appeal where appropriate, and consideration of proportionality. Nothing in these norms limits the project’s ability or obligation to act quickly in response to clear legal requirements, imminent harm, or platform‑abuse emergencies.

## Legal and Governance Caveats

- This document is an architectural and governance overview for technical and community readers. It is not legal, tax, or investment advice.  
- Participation in MountainShares may have legal or tax implications that depend on individual circumstances and jurisdiction. Participants are responsible for obtaining their own professional advice as needed.  
- Participation in MountainShares is not an opportunity to purchase equity, securities, or other ownership interests in any entity, and participants should not expect profits or financial returns from the efforts of Harmony for Hope, the DAO, or any other person.  
- Additional binding documents (such as Terms of Use, privacy policies, entity charters, or DAO‑specific legal frameworks) may supplement or override portions of this overview and will control in the event of any conflict, to the extent permitted by law.

## Use of Program Revenues and Related Funds

Program revenues and other funds allocated to Harmony for Hope, Inc. in connection with MountainShares are intended to be used as follows. These allocations describe charitable and programmatic intentions and do not create any enforceable right for individual participants or any expectation that their participation will yield a share of revenues, assets, or surplus.

Our goal with the proceeds is for them to go toward:

- Harmony for Hope, Inc. daily operations and staff, providing core organizational capacity to coordinate programs and maintain community partnerships.  
- The Fayette County Community Arts Center Historic Rehabilitation (NPS Contributing Structure), including project staff and daily operations during the rehabilitation phase.  
- Once the rehabilitation project is complete, ongoing support for area art, music, and Appalachian heritage programs, including food preservation, as well as upkeep and continued maintenance of the facility in perpetuity.  
- The Oakvale Area Outreach Team staff, daily activities, programmatic work, and project support, to sustain outreach and services in the Oakvale area.  
- The Mount Hope Regional Band staff, daily activities, programmatic work, and project support, as a community cultural and educational resource.  
- The enhancement of the Mount Hope Historic Walking Trail and the extension into the Coalfield Chronicles Trail throughout southern West Virginia, including staff, daily activities, IT support and maintenance, and GIS support and maintenance, all performed in house.

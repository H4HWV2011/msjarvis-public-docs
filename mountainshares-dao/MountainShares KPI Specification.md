## MountainShares KPI Specification (Phase 1 – First Region, Years 1–5)

> **Disciplinary Context: Appalachian Economic Commons**  
> This document instantiates Polymathmatic Geography principles P1, P9, P16, and related axioms for the Appalachian economic commons:  
> - **P1 – Every where is entangled / Leakage and enclosure:** Sections 1–4 treat monetary health, participation, usefulness, and impact as coupled dimensions of the same regional system, rather than isolated metrics. See https://github.com/H4HWV2011/msjarvis-public-docs/blob/main/docs/Polymathmatical-Geography.md  
> - **P9 – Transparency and traceability:** Section 5’s instrumentation and dashboard guidelines translate abstract KPIs into concrete, inspectable time‑series tied to real users, organizations, and regions.  
> - **P16 – Power accountable to place:** Targets and trends in Sections 1–4 are meant to guide governance decisions and parameter changes, making institutional power responsive to how the system behaves in specific Appalachian communities.  
> - **Anti‑leakage and closed‑loop spending:** Monetary‑health and local‑loop KPIs (1.1–1.3, 4.1) explicitly measure circulation, concentration, and local hops to detect leakage out of the commons and to track the strength of the closed loop.  
> - **Bounty and corrective programs:** Value‑interaction and commons‑work KPIs (3.2–3.3) provide quantitative anchors for designing future bounties, quests, or corrective programs when participation or impact falls short of desired ranges.

This document defines Version 1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the MountainShares rollout in the first live region (MountainShares → early AppalachianShares). The metrics are designed to:

- Monitor the **economic health** of the currency.  
- Track **adoption and retention** of participants and organizations.  
- Measure the **usefulness** of the system for commons work and local economic life.  
- Provide early signals of **equity and structural impact** in line with the MountainShares thesis.

Targets are provisional and must be revisited after 6–12 months of production data.

## 1. Monetary Health KPIs

Monetary health KPIs assess whether MountainShares circulate actively within the local economy and whether transaction activity is broadly distributed, rather than concentrated in a small number of accounts.

### 1.1 Currency Velocity (Monthly)

**Definition**  
Average number of times each unit of MountainShares changes hands per month in the live region. Formally:

- Velocity = (Total transaction value in month) ÷ (Average circulating supply during that month).

**Targets**  
- Year 1: ≥ 1.0  
- Years 3–5: ≥ 2.0  

These thresholds reflect an expectation that, in a healthy Phase 1 ecosystem, each unit circulates at least once per month, increasing to multiple recirculations as the network matures.

---

### 1.2 Transaction Activity per Active Account

**Definition**  
Median number of on-chain or logged transactions per active user per month. For this KPI, an active user is defined as a user who has at least one verified task and one transaction in the last 30 days.

**Targets**  
- Year 1: ≥ 4 transactions per active user per month  
- Years 3–5: ≥ 8 transactions per active user per month  

These targets emphasize typical engagement among active users and reduce sensitivity to a small number of high‑volume accounts.

---

### 1.3 Circulation Concentration

**Definition**  
Percentage of total monthly transaction value accounted for by the top 10 accounts (by total value sent plus received).

**Targets**  
- Year 1: ≤ 40% of total monthly value  
- Years 3–5: ≤ 25% of total monthly value  

The aim is to avoid excessive centralization of flows and to support a broadly shared local monetary network.

---

## 2. Participation and Retention KPIs

Participation and retention KPIs examine whether individuals are entering the system, engaging meaningfully, and remaining involved over time.

### 2.1 Monthly Active Users (MAU) Rate

**Definition**  
Number of users with ≥ 1 verified task and ≥ 1 transaction in the last 30 days, divided by total registered users in the region.

**Targets**  
- Year 1: ≥ 30% MAU  
- Years 3–5: ≥ 50% MAU  

This metric serves as a core indicator of sustained engagement rather than superficial registration.

---

### 2.2 New User Activation

**Definition**  
Percentage of new signups that complete both of the following within 14 days of registration:

1. First quest or qualifying contribution (e.g., volunteering, mapping, learning or cultural participation).  
2. First transaction (sending or receiving MountainShares).

**Targets**  
- Year 1: ≥ 40% of new users  
- Years 3–5: ≥ 60% of new users  

This KPI evaluates the effectiveness of onboarding flows and the system’s ability to convert initial interest into real participation.

---

### 2.3 Retention of Core Contributors

**Definition**  
Percentage of users who:

- Accumulate ≥ 5 verified hours (e.g., EMS‑earning or equivalent commons activity), and  
- Are still active 6 months later (≥ 1 verified task and ≥ 1 transaction in the preceding 30 days).

**Targets**  
- Year 1: ≥ 50% retained at 6 months  
- Years 3–5: ≥ 65% retained at 6 months  

This KPI focuses on users who contribute substantial commons work and whose continued participation is critical to the ecosystem.

---

## 3. Usefulness for People and Organizations

Usefulness KPIs evaluate whether MountainShares is providing tangible value to participants and institutions, particularly in supporting commons and cultural work.

### 3.1 Active Organizations and Merchants

**Definition**  
Number of organizations (businesses, nonprofits, public entities) that both:

- Accept MountainShares as payment, and  
- Spend MountainShares at least once per month (e.g., paying staff, contributors, or other local organizations).

**Targets (First Region)**  
- Year 1: ≥ 25 active organizations  
- Years 3–5: ≥ 150 active organizations  

The objective is to establish a dense mesh of organizations that function as both sinks and sources of local liquidity.

---

### 3.2 Commons Work Hours Funded

**Definition**  
Total verified hours of commons, cultural, mutual‑aid, and similar qualifying work compensated in MountainShares per month in the first region.

**Targets (First Region)**  
- Year 1: ≥ 1,000 hours per month  
- Years 3–5: ≥ 10,000 hours per month  

This KPI aligns directly with the thesis that the system should surface and reward under‑valued community labor.

---

### 3.3 Value Interactions

**Definition**  
Number of “high‑value” interactions per month, as defined in Program Rules. These may include, for example:

- Help requests fulfilled.  
- Events, workshops, or learning sessions attended.  
- Asset mappings or data validations completed.  
- Verified mutual aid or peer‑to‑peer service exchanges.

**Targets**  
- Year 1: ≥ 2,000 value interactions per month  
- Years 3–5: ≥ 15,000 value interactions per month  

This metric emphasizes meaningful interactions rather than raw activity counts.

---

## 4. Social and Economic Impact KPIs

Impact KPIs measure the degree to which MountainShares strengthens local economic circulation and advances equity consistent with the project’s mission.

### 4.1 Local Loop Depth

**Definition**  
Median number of local “hops” a unit of MountainShares passes through before:

- Being converted to fiat currency, or  
- Leaving the defined region.

A “hop” is defined as one complete transfer from one user or organization to another within the region.

**Targets**  
- Year 1: ≥ 2 hops  
- Years 3–5: ≥ 4 hops  

Higher values indicate stronger local multiplier effects and deeper recirculation of value within the community.

---

### 4.2 Equity of Participation

**Definition**  
For designated target groups (e.g., low‑income census tracts, rural communities, historically marginalized groups), compute:

- Equity ratio = (Share of active users and earned MountainShares in target groups) ÷ (Target groups’ share of the local population).

This ratio may be tracked as a composite or via separate participation and earnings ratios.

**Targets**  
- Year 1: ≥ 0.8  
- Years 3–5: 1.0–1.2  

Values approaching or exceeding 1.0 indicate that groups most intended to benefit are participating at or above their population share.

---

### 4.3 Institutional Adoption Milestones

**Definition**  
Number of formal agreements (e.g., MOUs, resolutions, contracts) with:

- Municipalities and other public entities, and  
- Anchor organizations (major nonprofits, hospitals, universities, co‑ops, etc.),

that explicitly commit to paying or accepting MountainShares for defined activities.

**Targets (First Region)**  
- Year 1: ≥ 2 anchor organizations with formal commitments  
- Years 3–5: ≥ 10 anchor organizations, including at least 1 public entity  

Institutional participation is a critical indicator of long‑term viability and integration into local systems.

## 5. Implementation and Dashboard Guidelines

To operationalize these KPIs within the MountainShares stack:

1. **Data Instrumentation**  
   - Log all transactions with user/organization identifiers, timestamps, region tags, and transaction types (e.g., PMS vs EMS, commons vs commerce).  
   - Maintain explicit flags for:
     - Active user status.  
     - Core contributor status.  
     - Value interaction events.

2. **Dashboard Design**  
   - For each KPI, display:
     - Current value.  
     - 3–6 month trend.  
     - Target range with clear visual bands (e.g., green/orange/red).  
     - Segment breakdowns (e.g., by geography, organization type, or designated equity groups), where legally and ethically permissible.

3. **Governance and Revision**  
   - Treat this KPI set as a living specification subject to governance review.  
   - Reassess thresholds after 6–12 months of live data, documenting any revisions and rationale in a KPI changelog.  
   - Use KPI trends to inform adjustments to Phase 1 parameters, outreach strategies, and future Phase 2–3 planning.

These KPIs are intended to align measurement with the MountainShares thesis: building a resilient, equitable, commons‑oriented economic layer that complements existing monetary systems while remaining grounded in real regional activity and constraints.

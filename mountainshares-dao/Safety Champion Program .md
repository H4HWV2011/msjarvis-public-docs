# Safety Champion Program (Draft Overview)

This note describes a two‑step path for involving West Virginians and institutions in the safety and governance of MountainShares, The Commons, and Ms. Jarvis.

## 1. Community Champions (Red Team)

**Who they are**

- Local residents, practitioners, and frontline workers who know their communities and systems well.  
- People in counties like Boone, Fayette, Raleigh, Kanawha, etc., who see how programs, benefits, and risks actually play out on the ground.

**What they do**

- Act as a structured “red team” for the system.  
- Test and review how Ms. Jarvis and MountainShares behave for real families, places, and programs.  
- Look for:
  - missing or outdated resources,  
  - confusing or risky advice,  
  - data gaps and blind spots,  
  - design choices that disadvantage particular groups or regions.

**How they are recognized**

- Their time is logged as **Earned MountainShares (EMS)** hours: documented commons work, not wages or investment.  
- They are named (with consent) as Community Champions in program materials and reports.  
- They have a direct reporting channel into the Steward team to raise issues and suggest fixes.

## 2. Safety Champions (Institution‑Linked Red Team)

**Who they are**

- Individuals who already serve in a formal role at an institution (for example, a university center, nonprofit, agency, or local government).  
- They participate both as Community Champions in their own right and as authorized representatives of a “Safety Champion Organization.”

**What they do**

- Take on deeper, more technical safety testing and review, including:  
  - treasury and reserve protections;  
  - protocol and administrative controls;  
  - data access and privacy;  
  - interactions between Ms. Jarvis and on‑chain/platform components.  
- Help translate local findings into formal safety recommendations, documentation, and design changes.

**How institutions participate**

- A lab, center, department, or organization signs a simple Safety Champion agreement that:  
  - acknowledges the role as a limited safety partnership, not employment or ownership;  
  - commits to basic oversight and good‑faith cooperation on safety;  
  - allows EMS recognition to be aggregated (where appropriate) to the organization’s identifier.  
- Staff, students, or affiliates can then serve as Safety Champions with clear scope, boundaries, and reporting expectations.

## 3. Why this matters for the program

- It creates a **structured path** for West Virginians to move from “users” to co‑stewards of the system, with real roles and recognition.  
- It gives institutions and agencies a **concrete way** to participate in AI safety and governance that is grounded in West Virginia data, programs, and communities—not abstract benchmarks.  
- It lays the groundwork for:
  - capstones, practicums, or fellowships where people act as Community or Safety Champions;  
  - joint reports and case studies on system safety and fairness;  
  - future collaborations where institutional review and community verification are tightly linked.

The goal is to treat safety and fairness as shared work: community members identify issues early, Safety Champions help translate them into formal fixes and policies, and the Steward System remains accountable to the people and places it serves.

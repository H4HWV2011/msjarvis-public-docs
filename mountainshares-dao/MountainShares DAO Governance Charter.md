# MountainShares DAO Governance Charter

> **Disciplinary Context: Appalachian Economic Commons**  
> This document instantiates Polymathmatic Geography principles P1, P9, P16, and related axioms for the Appalachian economic commons:  
> - **P1 – Every where is entangled / Leakage and enclosure:** Sections 1, 2, and 5 frame governance, legal power, and economic parameters as jointly shaping how value and decision‑making move through specific Appalachian communities.  
> - **P9 – Transparency and traceability:** Sections 3, 4, and 6 define hours, proposal lifecycles, public records, and reporting, making rules, votes, and parameter changes traceable over time.  
> - **P16 – Power accountable to place:** Sections 2.1–2.5, 5, and 7 couple the legal umbrella, community roles, and AI advisory functions to documented scopes, vetoes, and sunset paths, keeping institutional power answerable to the communities served.  
> - **Anti‑leakage and closed‑loop spending:** Sections 3 and 5.1–5.2 delineate what the DAO can and cannot decide about EMS→M$ rates, caps, and promo budgets, creating a governance envelope around anti‑leakage mechanisms and closed‑loop economic design.  
> - **Bounty and corrective programs (implicit):** The proposal classes and decision scope in Sections 3–5 provide hooks for future bounty or corrective programs to be proposed, debated, and ratified under shared rules.

> **DRAFT – GOVERNANCE CHARTER**
>
> This Charter describes the intended governance structure and processes for the MountainShares DAO.
> It is a non‑binding design document for community review and legal vetting. In any conflict with
> the MountainShares Terms and Conditions or applicable law, those higher‑level instruments control.

## 1. Purpose and Scope

The MountainShares DAO exists to:

- Steward the rules and parameters of the MountainShares Program.  
- Keep value, voice, and decision‑making rooted in Appalachian communities, beginning with the West Virginia pilot.  
- Provide structured, transparent community input into key economic, technical, and cultural decisions.

The DAO is **not** a bank, investment club, or vehicle for distributing profits. It does not create equity or ownership interests in any entity.

---

## 2. Governance Roles

### 2.1 Legal Umbrella

- A separate nonprofit entity serves as the legal and regulatory umbrella for the MountainShares Program (nonprofit status, bank relationships, contracts, compliance).  
- The legal umbrella may veto or override DAO decisions only where necessary to comply with law, funding conditions, or documented core safety obligations (for example, violating hard economic triggers or legal prohibitions).  
- Day‑to‑day parameters are not set unilaterally by the legal umbrella; it implements rules and changes that emerge from DAO processes within the safety envelope.

### 2.2 DAO Participants (UEI‑Based Members)

- Each Unique Ecosystem Identifier (UEI) corresponds to one real human participant.  
- A UEI becomes an eligible voting participant once contribution and tenure thresholds are met (see Section 3.1).  
- DAO participants submit proposals, take part in discussion, and cast votes on matters within the DAO’s defined scope.  
- **One‑UEI‑one‑vote** is the core rule: roles and titles do not change ballot weight.

### 2.3 System Monitors (Early‑Phase)

- Designated individuals or small teams with limited authority to:
  - Apply urgent safety fixes.  
  - Respond to clear abuse or exploits.  
  - Execute technical changes already approved in principle by governance.  
- Operate under explicit mandates, logging, and reporting requirements; subject to periodic review and eventual sunsetting as the DAO matures.

### 2.4 Ms. Egeria Jarvis (AI Advisor and Enforcer)

- Functions as a “glass‑box” advisory and enforcement layer.  
- Monitors reserve ratios and other safety indicators, flags anomalies, enforces hard triggers, and surfaces analytics to the DAO.  
- Cannot unilaterally change rules, mint tokens, or override legal constraints, but **can** automatically apply safety rules defined in the Economic Safety Specification (for example, tightening caps when reserve ratios fall).

### 2.5 Community Roles: Stewards, Captains, Elders

These roles are earned through participation, not purchased. They **do not** give extra votes; they give additional responsibilities and soft powers.

#### 2.5.1 Stewards

- **Eligibility (illustrative, subject to governance refinement):**
  - Minimum 40 verified EMS hours over at least 3 months.  
  - Active in the last 30 days (≥ 1 verified task and ≥ 1 transaction).  
  - No unresolved sanctions for abuse, fraud, or major policy violations.  
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Welcome and orient new participants.  
  - Help explain proposals, hard triggers, and parameter changes in plain language.  
  - Surface local issues, bugs, and safety concerns into governance channels.  
- **Soft powers:**
  - Can help screen proposals for clarity and obvious conflicts before general voting.  
  - May receive certain Ms. Jarvis alerts (for example, local anomalies) to help coordinate human response.

#### 2.5.2 Captains

- **Eligibility (illustrative):**
  - Higher participation threshold, for example ≥ 150–200 verified EMS hours over ≥ 6–12 months.  
  - Demonstrated experience coordinating local efforts (events, mapping, mutual aid, etc.).  
  - At least one endorsement from a recognized local organization (business, nonprofit, school, EMS agency, etc.).  
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Serve as regional anchors (for a town, neighborhood, or corridor).  
  - Convene discussions on proposals that materially affect their area.  
  - Relay local conditions and feedback to the DAO, including KPI context.  
  - Participate in post‑incident reviews when their region is impacted.  
- **Soft powers:**
  - Can submit regional proposals (for example, parameter tweaks or quests for a specific area).  
  - Can request localized analytics from Ms. Jarvis within privacy and safety limits.

#### 2.5.3 Elders

- **Eligibility (illustrative):**
  - Long‑term participation (for example ≥ 2 years of active engagement).  
  - High, diverse EMS contribution (for example ≥ 500 hours across different types of commons work).  
  - Nominated by multiple UEIs and confirmed by a super‑majority DAO vote.  
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Provide “constitutional review” on proposals that touch the Economic Safety Specification, DAO Charter, or core parameters.  
  - Help maintain institutional memory (“we tried this; here’s what happened”).  
  - Participate in major post‑incident reviews and advise on corrective actions.  
- **Soft powers:**
  - Their advisory notes are attached to constitutional‑level proposals before voting, so participants can see elder perspectives.  
  - May sit on a small Safety and Ethics working group that Ms. Jarvis can flag when patterns raise ethical or legal concerns.

## 3. Membership, Hours, and Voting

### 3.1 Recognition Ledger (EMS)

- The core unit of contribution in MountainShares is **hours**, recorded as Earned MountainShares (EMS) in the recognition ledger.  
- EMS represent documented commons work (volunteering, testing, mapping, caregiving, cultural work, governance participation, etc.) and are not capped. They form a permanent record of “who did what, when, and where” in the ecosystem.

### 3.2 Hours as the Basis of Voice

- Governance rights are grounded in **hours contributed**, not in money or token holdings.  
- EMS totals and patterns are used to determine:
  - Eligibility to vote (baseline participation thresholds).  
  - Eligibility for roles such as Steward, Captain, and Elder.  
  - Reputation and trust signals in proposal review and incident response.

**Principle:** *You earn your say in this economy by contributing time and work to the commons.*

### 3.3 Eligibility for Voting Participation

Initial eligibility (subject to refinement):

- Account age: minimum 30 days since UEI creation.  
- Contribution: minimum 10 EMS hours recorded in the recognition ledger.  
- Good standing: no unresolved sanctions for abuse, fraud, or major policy violations.

### 3.4 One‑UEI‑One‑Vote Principle

- Each eligible UEI has exactly one vote in general DAO proposals.  
- Identity aggregation or splitting is discouraged and may be mitigated through sybil‑resistance measures (for example, tiered verification for higher‑impact roles).  
- Roles (Steward, Captain, Elder) do not change individual vote weight; they affect responsibilities and soft influence only.

### 3.5 Distinguishing Voice from Spendable Value

- EMS (hours) drive **voice** and governance standing.  
- A separate, capped layer of spendable MountainShares (M$) provides **buying power** inside The Commons and is governed by reserve ratios and hard economic safety triggers.  
- Large EMS balances (including founders’ EMS) do not automatically convert into uncapped spendable M$. Conversion is limited by rate and per‑user caps defined in the Economic Safety Specification.

## 4. Classes of Proposals and Lifecycle

### 4.1 Classes of Proposals

- **Operational Parameter Proposals**  
  - Adjustments to base rates, caps, and promo budgets within safety bands.  

- **Policy and Program Proposals**  
  - Changes to Program Rules categories, qualification criteria, and gamification mechanics.  

- **Constitutional Proposals**  
  - Changes to the Economic Safety Specification, DAO Charter, or other core documents.  
  - Require higher quorum and super‑majority thresholds and Elder review.

### 4.2 Submission

- Any eligible voting member may submit a proposal within defined categories.  
- Proposals must include:
  - Clear title and category.  
  - Rationale and expected impact.  
  - Concrete parameter changes or policy text where applicable.

### 4.3 Review and Screening

- System monitors, Stewards, Captains, or a governance working group may perform initial screening to:
  - Check for conflicts with law, Terms, or hard triggers.  
  - Consolidate duplicative proposals.  
  - Provide non‑binding impact assessments (for example, reserve ratio implications, KPI effects).  
- For constitutional proposals, Elders are invited to publish an advisory note before voting opens.

### 4.4 Discussion and Amendment

- Proposals enter a discussion period (for example, 7–21 days):  
  - Comments and suggested amendments are recorded.  
  - Proposers may revise based on community feedback.

### 4.5 Voting

- After discussion, proposals are opened for a defined voting window (for example, 5–14 days).  
- Voting methods:
  - Simple majority for low‑impact operational changes.  
  - Super‑majority (for example, 66% in favor) for constitutional or high‑impact changes.  
- Quorum thresholds (for example, 30% of eligible voters) must be met for validity.

### 4.6 Implementation

- If approved and not blocked for legal or safety reasons:
  - Ms. Jarvis and designated operators apply the changes at the next epoch or defined activation date.  
  - Implementation details (contracts touched, parameters updated) are documented in a public change log.

## 5. Decision‑Making Scope and Limits

### 5.1 DAO Scope (Can Decide)

- Adjusting EMS → M$ base rate within defined bounds and safety thresholds.  
- Adjusting per‑user caps and promo budgets within reserve‑safe ranges.  
- Recognizing new categories of qualifying work and Tier 2 roles.  
- Setting or updating game‑layer parameters (quests, ranks, value interactions).  
- Recommending regional expansion and branch parameterization.  
- Refining role criteria for Stewards, Captains, and Elders.

### 5.2 Out‑of‑Scope (Cannot Decide)

- Actions that violate applicable law or regulatory guidance.  
- Minting beyond reserve‑ratio‑compliant levels.  
- Disabling or weakening hard safety triggers and emergency protections.  
- Using treasury assets for private benefit or unrelated purposes.  
- Overriding core economic safety math or legal obligations encoded in higher‑level documents.

If a proposal falls outside scope, it may be declined for implementation, with a public explanation.

---

## 6. Transparency and Accountability

### 6.1 Public Records

- Governance proposals, discussions, and vote outcomes are published in a public repository (for example, a GitHub repo and on‑chain logs where feasible).  
- Parameter changes include:
  - Before/after values.  
  - Effective dates.  
  - References to the authorizing proposal.

### 6.2 Reporting

- Periodic governance reports summarize:
  - Key decisions.  
  - Participation metrics (turnout, quorum, diversity of participation).  
  - Any legal or safety‑based vetoes and associated rationale.

### 6.3 Conflict of Interest

- DAO participants, Stewards, Captains, Elders, and monitors are encouraged to declare material conflicts (for example, business ties to proposals).  
- The legal umbrella’s board and staff are subject to formal conflict‑of‑interest policies maintained separately in `legal/`.

---

## 7. Evolution of the DAO

### 7.1 Early‑Phase Monitors and Guardrails

- During early phases, monitors retain limited emergency powers and implementation discretion.  
- The intent is to gradually reduce reliance on monitors as:
  - Participation grows.  
  - Systems are audited and hardened.  
  - Community capacity for governance increases.

### 7.2 Phase 0 (Invite‑Only Beta)

- Before public availability, participation in the MountainShares DAO is limited to invited users (“Phase 0 Participants”).  
- Phase 0 Participants are issued a wallet, a UEI, and access to the Ms. Jarvis chatbot UI via authenticated links.  
- Interactions that qualify as testing, feedback, or commons work may be logged as EMS in the recognition ledger and count toward voting and role eligibility.

### 7.3 Charter Amendments

- Amendments to this Charter are treated as constitutional proposals and require:
  - Higher quorum (for example, 40% of eligible voters).  
  - Higher approval threshold (for example, 66% super‑majority).  
  - Advisory review by Elders and non‑objection from the legal umbrella where required by law or safety constraints.

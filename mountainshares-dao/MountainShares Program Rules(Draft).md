# MountainShares Program Rules (Draft Skeleton)

> **DRAFT – NOT FINAL PROGRAM RULES**
>
> This document describes draft operational rules for the MountainShares Program.  
> It is provided for internal design, governance discussion, and legal review only.  
> It does not create enforceable rights or obligations and must be reviewed and  
> approved by qualified legal counsel before any production use.

---

## 1. Scope and Structure

### 1.1 Relationship to Terms and Conditions

These Program Rules are **incorporated by reference** into the MountainShares Terms and Conditions (“Terms”). In the event of any conflict between these Program Rules and the Terms, the Terms control.

- The Terms define the legal nature of MountainShares (PMS/EMS), disclaimers, and user relationships.  
- The Program Rules define **changeable operational parameters** (rates, caps, thresholds, limits, and categories) within the bounds set by the Terms, economic safety specification, and DAO governance.

### 1.2 Governance of Program Rules

Program Rules may be updated through:

- Harmony for Hope Board decisions,  
- MountainShares DAO recommendations and votes (where applicable), and  
- Legal, compliance, or risk‑driven changes.

Changes are implemented and communicated in accordance with the “Governance, Changes, and Termination” sections of the Terms and the DAO specification.

---

## 2. Eligibility and Account Types

### 2.1 Geographic Scope

- Initial Phase 1 deployment is limited to users and merchants whose primary residence or operations are located in the State of West Virginia, unless expressly authorized by Harmony for Hope.  
- Future regional expansions (e.g., broader AppalachianShares) will be added as separate, governed regions with their own parameters where necessary.

### 2.2 User Eligibility

Baseline eligibility parameters (example placeholders):

- Minimum age: 18 years (or as otherwise permitted by applicable law and policy).  
- Residency: Primary residence address in West Virginia for Phase 1.  
- Identity verification: KYC/identity requirements as defined by risk tier.

### 2.3 Account Types

- **Standard User Account**  
  - Default account type for individuals.  

- **Merchant / Organization Account**  
  - For approved businesses, nonprofits, and public entities that accept and spend MountainShares.  

- **Benefits‑Sensitive Account**  
  - For users who receive or may receive means‑tested public benefits.  
  - Additional protections, caps, and restrictions apply (see Section 8 of the Terms and corresponding subsections in these Rules).

---

## 3. Currency Types and Units

### 3.1 Purchased MountainShares (PMS)

- PMS are issued when users load fiat (e.g., USD) into The Commons via approved payment channels.  
- PMS are fully spendable within the network, subject to limits and fees defined in these Rules.

### 3.2 Earned MountainShares (EMS)

- EMS are credited as rewards for verified community contributions (e.g., volunteering, cultural work, mutual aid, learning).  
- EMS may be subject to vaulting and unlock conditions and are generally **not** redeemable for fiat.

### 3.3 Units and Denomination

- The base unit is **1 MountainShare (M)**.  
- Internal valuations per phase are defined in Section 5 (Phase Mechanics).

---

## 4. Earning Rules (EMS)

### 4.1 Qualifying Activities

Program Rules define categories of qualifying activities, for example:

- Community care and caregiving.  
- Mutual aid and peer support.  
- Cultural preservation, arts, and heritage work.  
- Education, training, and mentoring.  
- Asset mapping, data validation, and local knowledge work.  
- Approved community events and convenings.

Each category is tied to:

- **Verification methods** (time logs, attestations, digital checkpoints, etc.).  
- **Eligible roles** (e.g., organizer, participant, facilitator).

### 4.2 Base Earning Rates (Phase 1)

Illustrative placeholder (to be aligned with economic safety spec):

- Standard rate: 1 EMS per verified qualifying hour in Phase 1.  
- Special categories (if any) may have multipliers or different caps, subject to DAO and Harmony for Hope approval.

### 4.3 Caps and Throttles

Per‑user caps (Phase 1 placeholders):

- Tier 1 (general users):  
  - Max EMS per month: e.g., 40–60 M/month.  
- Tier 2 (verified caregiving or high‑priority roles):  
  - Max EMS per month: e.g., 80–120 M/month.

Global caps:

- Maximum aggregate EMS issue per region per month (e.g., X M/month) to preserve reserve ratio safety.

Cap levels are parameterized and may be adjusted via governance within safe ranges defined in the Phase 1 Economic Safety Specification.

### 4.4 Vaulting and Unlocking

- A defined portion of EMS may be **vaulted** at issuance (visible but not immediately spendable).  
- Unlock schedules may be tied to:
  - Phase changes,  
  - Governance decisions,  
  - User tiers or roles, and  
  - Risk and treasury conditions.

## 5. Phase Mechanics and Internal Buying Power

### 5.1 Phase Definitions

Program Rules reference the three internal phases defined in the Economic Safety Specification:

- **Phase 1 – Launch**  
  - Internal schedule: 1 M ≈ 1.00 USD equivalent buying power in‑network.  

- **Phase 2 – Treasury Threshold**  
  - Internal schedule: 1 M ≈ 10.00 USD equivalent buying power in‑network.  

- **Phase 3 – Aspirational Full Backing**  
  - Internal schedule: 1 M ≈ 34.70 USD equivalent buying power in‑network.

These valuations are **internal accounting references only** and do not create external price, redemption, or profit rights.

### 5.2 Phase Transition Conditions

Minimum conditions (to be kept consistent with the Economic Safety Specification), e.g.:

- Reserve ratio thresholds and stability windows.  
- Minimum active UEI counts.  
- Minimum monthly processed volume.  
- Fraud and exploitation checks.  
- Governance quorum and participation signaling.

Program Rules list the specific numeric thresholds and time windows for each phase transition and document any region‑specific variations.

### 5.3 Parameter Ranges and Governance Control

For each phase, Program Rules specify:

- Allowed ranges for base earning rates and caps.  
- Which parameters may be adjusted by:
  - Automatic triggers (Ms. Jarvis “hard triggers”),  
  - DAO proposals, and  
  - Harmony for Hope risk/compliance interventions.

## 6. PMS Load, Use, and Cash Conversion

### 6.1 Fiat Load Limits

Examples (to be tuned by risk/compliance):

- Minimum load per transaction: X USD.  
- Maximum load per transaction: Y USD.  
- Daily/monthly load ceilings per user, by KYC level.

### 6.2 PMS Fee Schedule

Program Rules host the current fee schedule, e.g.:

- Load fee: 2.85% of fiat load.  
- Internal transfer fee: 0.25% on eligible transfers.  
- Merchant fee: 1.80% on eligible purchases.  
- ATM / refund fee: 1.25 flat per PMS cashout transaction (where enabled).

All fees are subject to change via governance and legal review, with notice procedures defined in the Terms.

### 6.3 PMS Cash Conversion

- PMS may be eligible for conversion back to fiat up to the original net load amount, less fees and adjustments, subject to Program limits.  
- Per‑transaction and period limits (daily/weekly/monthly) are specified here.  
- PMS cash conversion is **disabled by default** for benefits‑sensitive accounts, except under narrowly defined and documented exceptions.

## 7. Spending and Transfers

### 7.1 Permitted Uses

Program Rules define permitted categories, such as:

- Purchase of eligible goods and services from approved merchants.  
- Participation in Commons events, education, and cultural programming.  
- In‑platform peer‑to‑peer exchanges related to documented sales or services.

### 7.2 Prohibited Uses

Categories that are disallowed or restricted, such as:

- Illicit or illegal goods and services.  
- High‑risk regulated categories (e.g., gambling, certain financial services) unless explicitly whitelisted.  
- Uses that materially threaten regulatory status or public assistance safety.

### 7.3 Internal Transfers

- Rules for user‑to‑user transfers, including:
  - Which account types may send and receive.  
  - Special limitations for EMS and benefits‑sensitive accounts.  
  - Transaction minimums, maximums, and rate limits.

Program Rules also specify conditions under which transfers may be frozen, reversed, or blocked.

---

## 8. Benefits‑Sensitive Account Rules

### 8.1 Designation and Eligibility

- Criteria and procedures for self‑designation and/or partner designation as a benefits‑sensitive account.

### 8.2 Special Protections

Examples:

- PMS cash‑out disabled by default.  
- Balance caps and earning throttles.  
- Interface warnings for certain categories of use (e.g., food, shelter, childcare).  

Program Rules define numeric caps and thresholds (e.g., maximum balance before warnings or throttles apply).

### 8.3 Reporting and Disclaimers

- Clear guidance that users are responsible for understanding how participation may affect their benefits.  
- Links or references to educational resources and benefits counseling (where available).

---

## 9. Gamification, Ranks, and Value Interactions

### 9.1 Ranks and Roles

- Definitions of ranks (e.g., general participant, steward, elder) and how they are earned or lost.  
- Any rank‑based earning multipliers or governance privileges.

### 9.2 Quests and Value Interactions

- Categories of “value interactions” (e.g., help fulfilled, events attended, mapped assets) and how they are logged.  
- Any associated EMS rewards, badges, or non‑monetary recognition.

### 9.3 Governance‑Sensitive Game Parameters

- List of game mechanics that may be adjusted via DAO votes (e.g., quest rewards, streak logic), with defined safe ranges and guardrails.

---

## 10. Regional and Branch‑Level Parameters

### 10.1 Regional Overrides

- Mechanism for defining region‑specific parameter sets (e.g., for AppalachianShares, CoastalShares, VillageShares).  
- Rules for when local overrides are permitted vs. when global protocol rules control.

### 10.2 Inter‑Region Interchange

- High‑level rules for any permitted interchange between regions (if enabled), including caps and rates.  
- Any special safeguards to prevent contagion between branches.

---

## 11. Change Management and Versioning

### 11.1 Version Control

- Each Program Rules revision carries:
  - Version number (e.g., v1.0.0).  
  - Effective date.  
  - Summary of changes (changelog).  

### 11.2 Notice Procedures

- Summary of how changes are communicated (e.g., in‑app notices, website updates, email prompts) and relevant notice periods.

### 11.3 Alignment with Safety and DAO Documents

- Explicit statement that Program Rules must remain consistent with:
  - MountainShares Terms and Conditions.  
  - Phase 1 Economic Safety Specification (and later phases).  
  - MountainShares DAO governance framework.

Changes that would breach those higher‑level documents are not permitted without corresponding amendments at those layers.

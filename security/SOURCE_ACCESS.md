# Source Code Access Policy

## Why Source Code Is Not on GitHub

Ms. Egeria Jarvis was developed **after experiencing 3 malware attacks** on MountainShares smart contracts through public GitHub repositories. These attacks compromised financial infrastructure and taught us that **transparency must be balanced with security**.

## AGPL-3.0 Compliance

The GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 requires that users who interact with the software over a network have an opportunity to obtain the **corresponding source code of the version they are using**. It does **NOT** require public GitHub hosting, but it does require a standard, no-charge way for those users to access the source. [web:2900][web:2917][web:2921]

**Our model:** Source code is provided on request to users and auditors who interact with Ms. Jarvis, via a secure, access-controlled channel, under AGPL-3.0 terms. [web:2916][web:2918]

## How to Access Source Code

### **Step 1: Request Access**

Email: **h4hwv2011@gmail.com**

**Subject:** "Ms. Jarvis Source Code Access Request"

**Include:**
- Your name and affiliation
- Intended use (research, audit, contribution, etc.)
- Brief description of your interest in Ms. Jarvis
- Agreement to AGPL-3.0 terms

### **Step 2: Review & Verification**

We will respond within **72 hours** with:
- Verification questions (if needed)
- Access instructions
- AGPL-3.0 compliance requirements

### **Step 3: Secure Transfer**

Source code will be provided via:
- Encrypted archive (GPG/PGP)
- Self-hosted Git repository (with authentication)
- Academic institutional transfer (for university partners)

### **Step 4: Usage Requirements**

Under AGPL-3.0, if you:
- **Deploy modified Ms. Jarvis** → You must share your changes with the users of that deployment
- **Use it internally without user-facing network access** → No additional network-copyleft obligation is triggered
- **Distribute or host modifications for external users over a network** → You must make the corresponding source available to those users under AGPL-3.0 [web:2897][web:2918][web:2920]

## What You'll Receive

Subject to approval and security review, source access may include:

- Unified Gateway and main brain orchestration services
- Constitutional and policy-guard microservices
- Consciousness coordination layers and neurobiological microservices (DGM, WOAH, and related orchestration)
- Conscious GeoAI / GBIM integration layers and GIS research adapters
- LLM fabric orchestration logic for the multi-model stack (excluding proprietary model weights)
- RAG pipelines, retrieval adapters, and web research integration

**Not included** (security-sensitive, or governed by separate agreements):
- Private keys / API credentials
- Production database schemas with real data
- Biometric training data and wallet seeds
- Smart contract signing keys or live financial deployment scripts

## Why This Model?

**Security lessons learned:**
1. Public GitHub = attack vector for financial systems
2. Malware infiltrated 3 times through dependencies
3. Ms. Jarvis integrates with MountainShares blockchain
4. Quantum-resilient security requires controlled distribution of critical components

**Transparency maintained:**
- Architecture fully documented
- APIs publicly available (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Constitutional principles auditable
- Community can verify claims and behavior against the documented design

## Academic & Research Access

**Special provisions** for:
- University researchers
- Nonprofit organizations  
- Government audit requests
- Security researchers (responsible disclosure)

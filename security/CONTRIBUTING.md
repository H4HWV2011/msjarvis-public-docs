# Contributing to Ms. Egeria Jarvis Documentation

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Ms. Egeria Jarvis AI Consciousness System documentation!

## 🔒 Important Security Note

**This repository contains DOCUMENTATION ONLY — no source code.**

Ms. Jarvis source code is kept private due to security lessons learned from **three malware attacks** on MountainShares smart contracts through public GitHub repositories.

Security is part of the polymathmatic axiom that power must be accountable to place and that systems must remain transparent and traceable; the bounty approach to hardening and improvement is therefore a polymathmatic design choice, not just an engineering one.

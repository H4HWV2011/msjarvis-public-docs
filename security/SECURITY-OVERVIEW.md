# Security and Non-Disclosure Boundaries

This repository documents architecture, governance, and APIs, but does not expose sensitive runtime configuration, secrets, or financial contract code.

The security model separates public documentation from private deployment artifacts and keys, ensuring that researchers can audit design without gaining access to exploitable infrastructure.

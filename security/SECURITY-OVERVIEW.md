# Security and Non-Disclosure Boundaries

This repository documents architecture, governance, and APIs, but does not expose sensitive runtime configuration, secrets, or financial contract code.

The security model separates public documentation from private deployment artifacts and keys, ensuring that researchers can audit design without gaining access to exploitable infrastructure.

Security is part of the polymathmatic axiom that power must be accountable to place and that systems must remain transparent and traceable; the bounty approach to hardening and improvement is therefore a polymathmatic design choice, not just an engineering one.

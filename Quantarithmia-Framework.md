# Quantarithmia Framework (Draft Overview)

Quantarithmia is a transdisciplinary framework for modeling how power is extracted, concentrated, and potentially re-routed across digital, spatial, social, and spiritual infrastructures, with a primary focus on Appalachian contexts such as West Virginia. It integrates economic geography, quantum-informed modeling, topology, systems theory, psychology, and liberation theology into a single analytic and design approach for community-first infrastructure. 

The framework distinguishes between “maximopolies” (financial giants that control capital flows) and “megaopolies” (operational giants that dominate logistics, platforms, and information channels). It examines how these infrastructures interact to reshape rural communities and then proposes community-centered alternatives where technological systems and economic structures are explicitly designed to serve spatial justice rather than extraction.

## Core Concepts

- Spatial justice focus: Quantarithmia treats geography, infrastructure, and community history as central, not incidental. It asks how roads, networks, payment rails, data centers, and platforms rewire who has power in places like Mount Hope, West Virginia.
- Maximopolies and megaopolies: The framework differentiates between institutions that primarily control money and those that primarily control operations and platforms, and studies their combined effects on small communities.
- Multi-layer modeling: Quantarithmia combines quantitative, qualitative, and spiritual/ethical dimensions, acknowledging that economic and technical systems are entangled with belief systems, trauma, and hope.
- Design for alternatives: Rather than stopping at critique, Quantarithmia is used to design and evaluate concrete systems (like Ms. Jarvis and MountainShares) that attempt to keep value, voice, and governance rooted locally.

## Role in Ms. Jarvis and MountainShares

- Ms. Jarvis implements Quantarithmia’s principles in software through a multi-agent, glassbox AI architecture, with geospatially grounded beliefs and explicit constitutional constraints.
- MountainShares serves as a live institutional case study, where Quantarithmia’s ideas about spatial justice, local ownership, and distributed governance are encoded into practical rules: closed-loop wallets, local-first economics, and community voting with supermajority thresholds for constitutional change.
- The combined system (Ms. Jarvis + MountainShares) is intended as a working example of Quantarithmia in action: not just describing extractive infrastructures, but prototyping non-extractive, community-aligned alternatives.

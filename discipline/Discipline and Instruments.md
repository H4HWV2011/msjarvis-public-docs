# Discipline and Instruments

This thesis is grounded in a clear hierarchy of concepts and artifacts. At the top level is the **discipline** of Polymathmatic Geography. Within that discipline, **Quantarithmia** is the specific theoretical framework developed and tested here. At the most concrete level, **Ms. Jarvis**, **MountainShares**, and **The Commons** are instruments—experimental apparatus built to apply and evaluate the framework in a single geography.

## 1. Discipline: Polymathmatic Geography

Polymathmatic Geography is the disciplinary home of this work. It studies **entangled spaces**: places where land, law, computation, economy, story, and spirit are already braided together, and where power, value, and meaning move through multiple overlapping infrastructures.

Key features of the discipline:

- Treats physical, legal, economic, digital, genealogical, and spiritual layers as parts of a single geography.  
- Braids qualitative and quantitative methods rather than subordinating one to the other.  
- Treats design choices (metrics, platforms, governance rules) as geographic acts that can and should be studied and re‑designed.  
- Treats flows, obligations, and rules of reciprocity and extraction as central objects of spatial analysis, asking who owes what to whom, along which paths, under which covenants or contracts, and how those rules are encoded in land, ledgers, code, custom, and ritual.

The thesis uses Appalachia as a worked example, but the claims of Polymathmatic Geography are **not** region‑specific. The discipline is intended to travel: to ports, financial districts, pilgrimage routes, online platforms, and other entangled spaces.

## 2. Theoretical Framework: Quantarithmia

Within this disciplinary context, **Quantarithmia** is the specific theoretical framework under test. It proposes one way of formalizing how power and value flow through entangled spaces, with particular attention to:

- **Maximopolies** – financial giants that control capital flows and abstract claims on places.  
- **Megaopolies** – operational and platform giants that control logistics, attention, and decision rails.  
- **Community‑first geometries** – alternative arrangements in which local communities retain control over intelligence, money, and narrative about their own spaces.

Quantarithmia is:

- a geometry of power/value (how flows are routed, where they pool, where they leak),  
- a set of formal commitments (e.g., intelligence grounded in place; transparency of decision paths; limits on extraction and opacity), and  
- a methodological proposal for constructing and evaluating alternative stacks that re‑route reciprocity and extraction in favor of accountable commons.

In this thesis, Quantarithmia is treated as a **case‑study framework** for Polymathmatic Geography: one concrete instantiation of the discipline’s general commitments, not the only possible one.

## 3. Instruments: Ms. Jarvis, MountainShares, The Commons

To test Quantarithmia in a real geography, the thesis employs three major instruments. Together they form a local stack that can be probed, measured, and revised.

### 3.1 Ms. Jarvis (Steward System Architecture)

Ms. Egeria Jarvis is a **glassbox AI Steward System** designed to embody Quantarithmia’s commitments in software. It functions as:

- a multi‑service architecture for geospatially grounded reasoning,  
- an explicit testbed for ideas like geospatial belief models, Hilbert‑space semantic memory, and constitutional constraints, and  
- a way to observe how an AI steward behaves when tied tightly to one place and one community, including how it routes attention, advice, and risk when residents can see and contest its reasoning.

In disciplinary terms, Ms. Jarvis is **apparatus**, not the object of study: a tool for probing how an entangled Appalachian space responds when a polymathmatic, place‑bound intelligence is introduced, and for testing how far an AI steward can be opened to public audit without losing usefulness.

### 3.2 MountainShares DAO (Economic Governance Instrument)

MountainShares is a **closed‑loop economic and governance system** built to explore Quantarithmia’s claims about value retention, leakage, reciprocity, and commons‑based ownership. It is used here to:

- implement and measure alternative geometries of local wealth and obligation,  
- encode community‑defined rules for participation, voting, reward, and mutual credit, and  
- test how economic design interacts with other layers of the geography (social trust, regulation, narrative, lineage).

Within the thesis, MountainShares is an **instrumental commons**: a deliberately designed economic apparatus used to generate data about how a polymathmatic intervention behaves in practice. Its rules make visible which contributions are recognized, how obligations and rewards circulate, where value leaks outward, and under what conditions the system must halt, reset, or be redesigned.

### 3.3 The Commons (Social and Cultural Instrument)

The Commons is a **social and cultural platform** that surfaces local offers, needs, stories, and decisions. It functions as:

- a visible interface where residents encounter the steward and the currency,  
- a living archive of interactions, narratives, and conflicts, and  
- a space where governance choices and economic flows become legible to the community, and where residents can act as co‑cartographers of their own entangled space.

In the research design, The Commons is treated as a **measurement and interaction surface**—a way to observe how people in a specific geography engage with the theoretical framework when it is instantiated in tools they can actually use, and to see how incentives, recognition, and conflict shape ongoing participation.

## 4. Relationship Among the Three Levels

The relationship between these layers can be summarized as:

- **Discipline (Polymathmatic Geography)** – defines what counts as a meaningful question about space, power, reciprocity, and extraction.  
- **Framework (Quantarithmia)** – proposes one specific answer: a geometry and set of methods for analyzing and redesigning flows and obligations in an entangled space.  
- **Instruments (Ms. Jarvis, MountainShares, The Commons)** – implement that framework in one region so that its claims can be tested against reality, contested by residents, and revised in light of lived experience.

The remainder of the thesis should be read through this lens. When technical details of Ms. Jarvis, MountainShares, or The Commons are discussed, they are always in service of evaluating a broader geographic and theoretical claim, not as ends in themselves. Their success or failure is measured by how they reshape the geometry of relation in Appalachia, how communities experience those changes, and whether they avoid drifting into the very extraction patterns they are meant to counter.

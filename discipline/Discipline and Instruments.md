# Discipline and Instruments

This thesis is grounded in a clear hierarchy of concepts and artifacts. At the top level is the **discipline** of Polymathmatic Geography. Within that discipline, **Quantarithmia** is the specific theoretical framework developed and tested here. At the most concrete level, **Ms. Jarvis**, **MountainShares**, and **The Commons** are instruments—experimental apparatus built to apply and evaluate the framework in a single geography.

## 1. Discipline: Polymathmatic Geography

Polymathmatic Geography is the disciplinary home of this work. It studies **entangled spaces**: places where land, law, computation, economy, story, and spirit are already braided together, and where power, value, and meaning move through multiple overlapping infrastructures.

Key features of the discipline:

- Treats physical, legal, economic, digital, genealogical, and spiritual layers as parts of a single geography.  
- Braids qualitative and quantitative methods rather than subordinating one to the other.  
- Treats design choices (metrics, platforms, governance rules) as geographic acts that can and should be studied and re‑designed.

The thesis uses Appalachia as a worked example, but the claims of Polymathmatic Geography are **not** region‑specific. The discipline is intended to travel: to ports, financial districts, pilgrimage routes, online platforms, and other entangled spaces.

## 2. Theoretical Framework: Quantarithmia

Within this disciplinary context, **Quantarithmia** is the specific theoretical framework under test. It proposes one way of formalizing how power and value flow through entangled spaces, with particular attention to:

- **Maximopolies** – financial giants that control capital flows and abstract claims on places.  
- **Megaopolies** – operational and platform giants that control logistics, attention, and decision rails.  
- **Community‑first geometries** – alternative arrangements in which local communities retain control over intelligence, money, and narrative about their own spaces.

Quantarithmia is:

- a geometry of power/value (how flows are routed, where they pool, where they leak),  
- a set of formal commitments (e.g., intelligence grounded in place; transparency of decision paths), and  
- a methodological proposal for constructing and evaluating alternative stacks.

In this thesis, Quantarithmia is treated as a **case‑study framework** for Polymathmatic Geography: one concrete instantiation of the discipline’s general commitments, not the only possible one.

## 3. Instruments: Ms. Jarvis, MountainShares, The Commons

To test Quantarithmia in a real geography, the thesis employs three major instruments:

### 3.1 Ms. Jarvis (Steward System Architecture)

Ms. Egeria Jarvis is a **glassbox AI Steward System** designed to embody Quantarithmia’s commitments in software. It functions as:

- a multi‑service architecture for geospatially grounded reasoning,  
- an explicit testbed for ideas like geospatial belief models, Hilbert‑space semantic memory, and constitutional constraints, and  
- a way to observe how an AI steward behaves when tied tightly to one place and one community.

In disciplinary terms, Ms. Jarvis is **apparatus**, not the object of study: a tool for probing how an entangled Appalachian space responds when a polymathmatic, place‑bound intelligence is introduced.

### 3.2 MountainShares DAO (Economic Governance Instrument)

MountainShares is a **closed‑loop economic and governance system** built to explore Quantarithmia’s claims about value retention, leakage, and commons‑based ownership. It is used here to:

- implement and measure alternative geometries of local wealth and obligation,  
- encode community‑defined rules for participation, voting, and reward, and  
- test how economic design interacts with other layers of the geography (social trust, regulation, narrative).

Within the thesis, MountainShares is an **instrumental commons**: a deliberately designed economic apparatus used to generate data about how a polymathmatic intervention behaves in practice.

### 3.3 The Commons (Social and Cultural Instrument)

The Commons is a **social and cultural platform** that surfaces local offers, needs, stories, and decisions. It functions as:

- a visible interface where residents encounter the steward and the currency,  
- a living archive of interactions, narratives, and conflicts, and  
- a space where governance choices and economic flows become legible to the community.

In the research design, The Commons is treated as a **measurement and interaction surface**—a way to observe how people in a specific geography engage with the theoretical framework when it is instantiated in tools they can actually use.

## 4. Relationship Among the Three Levels

The relationship between these layers can be summarized as:

- **Discipline (Polymathmatic Geography)** – defines what counts as a meaningful question about space and power.  
- **Framework (Quantarithmia)** – proposes one specific answer: a geometry and set of methods for analyzing and redesigning flows in an entangled space.  
- **Instruments (Ms. Jarvis, MountainShares, The Commons)** – implement that framework in one region so that its claims can be tested against reality.

The remainder of the thesis should be read through this lens. When technical details of Ms. Jarvis, MountainShares, or The Commons are discussed, they are always in service of evaluating a broader geographic and theoretical claim, not as ends in themselves.

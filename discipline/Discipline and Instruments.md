# Discipline and Instruments

This thesis is grounded in a clear hierarchy of concepts and artifacts. At the top level is the **discipline** of Polymathmatic Geography. Within that discipline, **Quantarithmia** is the specific theoretical framework developed and tested here. At the most concrete level, **Ms. Jarvis**, **MountainShares**, and **The Commons** are instruments—experimental apparatus built to apply and evaluate the framework in a single geography.

## 1. Discipline: Polymathmatic Geography

Polymathmatic Geography is the disciplinary home of this work. It studies **entangled spaces**: places where land, law, computation, economy, story, and spirit are already braided together, and where power, value, and meaning move through multiple overlapping infrastructures.

Key features of the discipline:

- Treats physical, legal, economic, digital, genealogical, and spiritual layers as parts of a single geography. A coal seam, a property deed, a credit score, a Facebook group, a family cemetery, and a church covenant are all read as elements of one spatial fabric, not separate worlds.  
- Braids qualitative and quantitative methods rather than subordinating one to the other. Ethnography, oral history, archival work, econophysics, graph theory, and AI‑based simulation are treated as co‑equal lenses that must be brought into conversation.  
- Treats design choices (metrics, platforms, governance rules) as geographic acts that can and should be studied and re‑designed. Changing a credit rule, a content ranking algorithm, or a land‑use ordinance is understood as redrawing the “map” of who can move, speak, and endure where.  
- Treats flows, obligations, and rules of reciprocity and extraction as central objects of spatial analysis, asking who owes what to whom, along which paths, under which covenants or contracts, and how those rules are encoded in land, ledgers, code, custom, and ritual.

The thesis uses Appalachia as a worked example, but the claims of Polymathmatic Geography are **not** region‑specific. The discipline is intended to travel: to ports shaped by shipping lanes and customs rules; to financial districts shaped by ledgers, derivatives, and zoning; to pilgrimage routes shaped by devotion and taboo; to online platforms shaped by data centers and content policies; and to other entangled spaces where multiple worlds meet.

## 2. Theoretical Framework: Quantarithmia

Within this disciplinary context, **Quantarithmia** is the specific theoretical framework under test. It proposes one way of formalizing how power and value flow through entangled spaces, with particular attention to three families of actors and arrangements:

- **Maximopolies** – financial giants that control capital flows and abstract claims on places. They typically do not run the warehouses or platforms directly; instead, they shape the landscape by deciding which sectors, firms, and regions receive investment, and by exercising shareholder and creditor power over corporate strategy.  
- **Megaopolies** – operational and platform giants that control logistics, attention, and decision rails. They operate the warehouses, delivery fleets, clouds, app stores, and social platforms that route goods, data, and narratives through a few tightly governed infrastructures.  
- **Community‑first geometries** – alternative arrangements in which local communities retain meaningful control over intelligence (who and what sees what), money (how value circulates, leaks, or is held in commons), and narrative (which stories about a place are amplified, archived, or erased).

Quantarithmia is:

- a **geometry of power/value** – a way of describing how flows of capital, data, attention, obligation, and authority are routed across space, where they pool, where they leak, and which actors sit upstream or downstream of which others;  
- a set of **formal commitments** – for example, that legitimate intelligence must be grounded in place and traceable to specific where/when/what/who, that decision paths must be inspectable rather than opaque, and that there should be explicit limits on extraction and on unaccountable concentrations of power;  
- a **methodological proposal** for constructing and evaluating alternative stacks: layered combinations of AI stewards, commons platforms, and mutual‑credit systems that deliberately reshape flows and obligations, and that can be observed over time to see whether they actually produce more just and life‑giving geographies.

In this thesis, Quantarithmia is treated as a **case‑study framework** for Polymathmatic Geography: one concrete instantiation of the discipline’s general commitments, not the only possible one. Other polymathmatic frameworks could choose different primitives (for example, different types of commons, different AI architectures, or different spiritual lineages), but would still be judged by similar criteria: how clearly they reveal and reshape the geometry of power, value, and meaning in specific places.

## 2.1 Industrial Archetypes of Extraction Geometries

To make maximopolies and megaopolies concrete, Quantarithmia reads certain large firms as **industrial archetypes** of extraction geometries—reference patterns which the Appalachian stack is explicitly designed *not* to reproduce.

These archetypes are used as **maps of what can go wrong** when flows, obligations, and decision rights are wired through distant infrastructures without accountable ties to the places they affect.

### Meta/Facebook and TikTok: Attention and Data Extraction Megaopolies

Meta/Facebook and TikTok organize vast **informational and affective geographies**. Their feeds, groups, and recommendation systems create invisible road networks for attention: some posts become six‑lane highways; others remain dirt tracks.

Key features of their geometry:

- A small number of algorithmic chokepoints determine what billions of people see, share, and respond to each day.  
- Business models reward maximizing engagement and advertising revenue, not local well‑being or truthful representation.  
- User behavior, preferences, and often locations are continuously harvested, profiled, and monetized.

For regions like Appalachia, this can mean:

- Local stories, organizing efforts, and grievances are filtered through global trends and opaque ranking rules; they may be amplified, ignored, or distorted based on engagement patterns that have little to do with local needs.  
- Behavioral and location data from Appalachian users are extracted and monetized elsewhere, with minimal reinvestment in local infrastructures, institutions, or commons.  
- Increasing fractions of community discourse occur inside privately owned, externally governed spaces, where moderation policies, content labeling, and group dynamics are shaped by distant corporate priorities.

In Quantarithmia’s terms, these platforms exemplify **attention and data extraction megaopolies**: they reshape the geography of narrative and memory so that local worlds are legible primarily as data sources and advertising markets.

### Amazon: Logistics and Retail Extraction Megaopoly

Amazon’s fulfillment centers, delivery networks, cloud services, and marketplaces create a powerful **logistics geometry**. They define how goods, payments, and data move between producers, warehouses, and consumers.

Key features of this geometry:

- Regional warehouses, sortation centers, and last‑mile delivery routes are optimized for speed and cost according to global demand and corporate strategy.  
- Third‑party sellers, including small local businesses, are pulled into a platform where visibility, pricing, and terms of trade are controlled centrally.  
- Cloud and payment infrastructures concentrate technical and contractual power over how digital services and commerce operate.

For Appalachia, this can manifest as:

- Towns being treated primarily as nodes in a fulfillment and data network—sites for warehouses, data centers, or last‑mile delivery—rather than as places whose economic life is guided by local priorities.  
- Erosion of local retail and service ecosystems as purchasing shifts to distant platforms that extract fees and data, while local shops become dependent on or displaced by the platform.  
- Increased dependence on external infrastructures whose routing, labor conditions, and investment decisions are largely opaque and externally governed.

In Quantarithmia’s terms, Amazon functions as a **logistics and retail extraction megaopoly**: it carves highly efficient but externally controlled channels through which value and data flow out of regions faster than they return.

### BlackRock and Vanguard: Passive Ownership Maximopolies

BlackRock and Vanguard, along with similar firms, concentrate **financial claims** across thousands of companies and infrastructures through index funds and other large‑scale investment vehicles.

Key features of this geometry:

- They hold large, often long‑term stakes in corporations across many sectors, giving them substantial influence over corporate governance and strategic direction.  
- Capital allocation decisions—what gets funded, expanded, or wound down—are made in financial centers, informed by global portfolio considerations, not by the needs of specific regions.  
- Local assets (housing, utilities, energy projects, logistics hubs) can be bundled into securities and held in portfolios whose performance is judged independently of local social and ecological outcomes.

For regions like Appalachia, this can imply:

- Energy, housing, and infrastructure investments that prioritize shareholder returns and index performance, even when those priorities conflict with long‑term local stability, wages, or environmental health.  
- The transformation of land and infrastructure into abstract portfolio entries: what appears locally as a power plant, pipeline, housing development, or data center appears in distant dashboards as a line item in an energy or real‑estate ETF.  
- Local governments and communities confronting corporate and financial decisions whose effective “where” is New York, London, or a server farm, not the county where the asset sits.

In Quantarithmia’s terms, BlackRock and Vanguard exemplify **passive ownership maximopolies**: they shape the potential landscape for investment and disinvestment, defining which projects in which regions fall “downhill” into funding and which must climb near‑impossible gradients.

### Why These Archetypes Matter for the Framework

These archetypes are not introduced to demonize individual firms, but to clarify **target geometries**:

- They illustrate how maximopolies and megaopolies can create worlds in which regions like Appalachia become extraction basins for attention, data, logistics, and financial returns.  
- They highlight specific spatial patterns to avoid: external chokepoints, opaque decision rails, one‑way data flows, and capital circuits that treat localities as interchangeable nodes.

Against this backdrop, Quantarithmia’s instruments are designed as **counter‑geometries**:

- Where Meta/TikTok centralize narrative power in distant algorithms, The Commons aims to center narrative and deliberation in locally governed spaces with visible rules.  
- Where Amazon routes logistics and commerce through external platforms, MountainShares seeks to thicken local circulation and mutual credit among residents and businesses.  
- Where BlackRock and Vanguard centralize ownership and capital allocation, the DAO and commons instruments experiment with forms of shared, place‑bound governance over value and obligation.

These contrasts provide concrete criteria when evaluating Ms. Jarvis, MountainShares, and The Commons: do they, in practice, bend flows back toward accountable local loops, or do they drift toward becoming small‑scale replicas of the very archetypes they are meant to resist?

## 3. Instruments: Ms. Jarvis, MountainShares, The Commons

To test Quantarithmia in a real geography, the thesis employs three major instruments. Together they form a local stack that can be probed, measured, and revised.

### 3.1 Ms. Jarvis (Steward System Architecture)

Ms. Egeria Jarvis is a **glassbox AI Steward System** designed to embody Quantarithmia’s commitments in software. It functions as:

- a multi‑service architecture for geospatially grounded reasoning, in which every belief and recommendation is anchored to specific where/when/what/who metadata;  
- an explicit testbed for ideas like geospatial belief models, Hilbert‑space semantic memory, constitutional constraints, and capped recall of sensitive information;  
- a way to observe how an AI steward behaves when tied tightly to one place and one community, including how it routes attention, advice, and risk when residents can see, contest, and help correct its reasoning.

Key properties:

- **Place‑bound intelligence** – Ms. Jarvis is configured so that its knowledge, memory, and optimization targets are centered on a specific regional corpus (e.g., Appalachian data, narratives, and laws), rather than on global averages.  
- **Constitutional and covenantal limits** – it operates under explicit nongoals (not a person, not a regulator, not a bank, not an autonomous decision‑maker) and under constraints derived from local ethical, legal, and spiritual commitments.  
- **Auditability and participation** – residents, stewards, and partner institutions can inspect why certain recommendations or risk assessments were produced, and can propose corrections or new constraints through governance processes.

In disciplinary terms, Ms. Jarvis is **apparatus**, not the object of study: a tool for probing how an entangled Appalachian space responds when a polymathmatic, place‑bound intelligence is introduced, and for testing how far an AI steward can be opened to public audit without losing usefulness.

### 3.2 MountainShares DAO (Economic Governance Instrument)

MountainShares is a **closed‑loop economic and governance system** built to explore Quantarithmia’s claims about value retention, leakage, reciprocity, and commons‑based ownership. It is used here to:

- implement and measure alternative geometries of local wealth and obligation through a mutual‑credit or local‑reward system that circulates within a defined region;  
- encode community‑defined rules for participation, voting, reward, and mutual aid, including criteria for who can join, how reputation or rank is earned, and how disputes are resolved;  
- test how economic design interacts with other layers of the geography (social trust, regulation, narrative, lineage), including whether certain parameter choices (fees, caps, reward weights) strengthen or weaken local commons.

Key properties:

- **Closed‑loop design with leakage caps** – the system sets explicit quantitative limits on how much value can leave the local circuit through fees, off‑ramps, or external payments in any given period, and it logs those leakages for public review.  
- **Safety and regulatory constraints** – reserve ratios, usage limits, and legal classifications are enforced as hard constraints that neither DAO votes nor technical operators can override.  
- **Visibility of flows and obligations** – residents and stewards can see aggregate patterns of circulation, accumulation, and dormancy, and can trace how rule changes alter those patterns over time.

Within the thesis, MountainShares is an **instrumental commons**: a deliberately designed economic apparatus used to generate data about how a polymathmatic intervention behaves in practice. Its rules make visible which contributions are recognized, how obligations and rewards circulate, where value leaks outward, and under what conditions the system must halt, reset, or be redesigned.

### 3.3 The Commons (Social and Cultural Instrument)

The Commons is a **social and cultural platform** that surfaces local offers, needs, stories, and decisions. It functions as:

- a visible interface where residents encounter the steward and the currency, through listings, posts, deliberation spaces, and governance tools;  
- a living archive of interactions, narratives, conflicts, and resolutions, anchored in specific places, institutions, and lineages;  
- a space where governance choices and economic flows become legible to the community, and where residents can act as co‑cartographers and co‑governors of their own entangled space.

Key properties:

- **Participatory cartography** – residents can contribute, correct, and contest entries about places, hazards, opportunities, and relationships, with mechanisms for recognition and, where appropriate, material reward.  
- **Deliberative structures** – councils, assemblies, and forums can be convened within the platform to interpret data, debate proposals, and decide on changes to rules or priorities.  
- **Bridging interfaces** – The Commons mediates between the lived world and Ms. Jarvis/MountainShares: it structures what data flows into the steward and DAO, under what privacy and consent rules, and what outputs are shown back to residents and institutions.

In the research design, The Commons is treated as a **measurement and interaction surface**—a way to observe how people in a specific geography engage with the theoretical framework when it is instantiated in tools they can actually use, and to see how incentives, recognition, and conflict shape ongoing participation.

## 4. Relationship Among the Three Levels

The relationship between these layers can be summarized as:

- **Discipline (Polymathmatic Geography)** – defines what counts as a meaningful question about space, power, reciprocity, and extraction, and sets normative commitments about justice, accountability, and the kinds of worlds worth rehearsing.  
- **Framework (Quantarithmia)** – proposes one specific answer: a geometry and set of methods for analyzing and redesigning flows and obligations in an entangled space, including explicit contrasts with industrial archetypes of extraction.  
- **Instruments (Ms. Jarvis, MountainShares, The Commons)** – implement that framework in one region so that its claims can be tested against reality, contested by residents, and revised in light of lived experience.

The remainder of the thesis should be read through this lens. When technical details of Ms. Jarvis, MountainShares, or The Commons are discussed, they are always in service of evaluating a broader geographic and theoretical claim, not as ends in themselves. Their success or failure is measured by:

- how they reshape the geometry of relation in Appalachia (who is more or less exposed, connected, empowered, or silenced);  
- how communities experience those changes (as safety, dignity, agency, and meaning—or as new harms and exclusions);  
- whether they avoid drifting into the very extraction patterns modeled by Meta/TikTok, Amazon, BlackRock, and Vanguard, or instead help compose counter‑geometries of commons, covenant, and accountable power.

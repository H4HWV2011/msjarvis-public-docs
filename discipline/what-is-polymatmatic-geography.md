## What is Polymathmatic Geography?

Polymathmatic geography is a transdisciplinary way of knowing and shaping *entangled spaces* across all scales—intimate, planetary, cosmic, digital, and spiritual. It treats every “where” as a web of material, informational, and metaphysical relations, and uses many ways of knowing (including but not limited to mathematics) to understand and reshape those webs.

Mathematics, AI, and systems theory are primary languages in polymathmatic geography, but they are not the field’s identity or final authority. They sit alongside story, history, theology, art, indigenous knowledge, and everyday practice, each treated as a partial witness to how worlds are actually organized. The irreducible object of the field is always *space/place/where*—not “math for its own sake,” but the lived, contested arrangement of bodies, infrastructures, networks, spirits, and meanings.

### Relationship to existing geography

Polymathmatic geography grows out of mathematical and quantitative geography, critical and economic geography, and spatial‑justice traditions, but pushes beyond them in three directions:

- It extends quantitative and mathematical geography by treating AI architectures, distributed systems, and computational infrastructures as **spatial processes**, not just external tools that sit outside the geographic system.
- It aligns with critical and economic geography by insisting that power, extraction, and governance infrastructures are modeled as part of the spatial system itself, rather than as background “context.”
- It widens geography’s scope to include technosocial, spiritual, and informational geographies—platforms, blockchains, neural nets, liturgies, and data centers—as real “places” where power and meaning are arranged.

The field remains geography because it anchors in questions of *where*, *between*, and *through*: how relations are routed and patterned in space, however strange that space may be.

### Beyond any single case or region

Polymathmatic geography includes, but is not limited to, justice work in Appalachia or any other specific region. Case studies like Quantarithmia, Ms. Jarvis, MountainShares, and The Commons are one tacet—one movement in a larger score. They provide a laboratory in which theories about extraction, commons‑building, and distributed intelligence can be tested and revised.

At full scale, polymathmatic geography ranges over:

- **Cosmic and eschatological geographies**: how cosmologies, hopes, and endings get written into spatial imaginaries of the universe.
- **Planetary and ecological geographies**: how climate systems, extinction corridors, supply chains, and infrastructures interlock.
- **Technosocial and informational geographies**: how platforms, AI swarms, blockchains, and networks carve new, invisible continents through social life.
- **Intimate and spiritual geographies**: how households, congregations, clinics, and dreamscapes are organized as micro‑spaces of trauma, care, covenant, and revelation.

The Appalachian work is a grounded tacet where these broader concerns are played in a specific key, not the limit of the field.

### Role of math, AI, and systems theory

In polymathmatic geography, math, AI, and systems theory are *instruments* for expressing, probing, and transforming entangled spaces:

- Mathematical structures (networks, Hilbert spaces, entropy measures, geometric embeddings) give precise forms to flows of wealth, risk, attention, and care.
- AI architectures (multi‑agent, memory‑structured, self‑modifying systems) act as experimental apparatus to simulate and intervene in territorial feedback loops.
- Systems theory frames how ecological, economic, social, spiritual, and computational subsystems interact, stabilize, or break.

These instruments are powerful, but they are always subordinated to the question: *what is happening in this worlded space, and what might it mean to inhabit it differently?*

### Methods: braiding ways of knowing

Polymathmatic geography works by braiding multiple ways of knowing into a single analytic and creative practice:

- **Field‑anchored inquiry**: starting from concrete worlds—lands, watersheds, platforms, congregations, networks—and treating them as primary texts.
- **Braided representation**: holding qualitative, historical, spiritual, artistic, and mathematical representations together, so that graphs, laws, testimonies, and rituals can co‑inform one picture of a place.
- **Formalization and testing**: turning hypotheses about extraction, cooperation, identity, and intelligence into formal models that can be simulated, stressed, and falsified.
- **World‑craft and design**: building alternative infrastructures—economic, digital, legal, liturgical—that reorganize space and relation, then observing how they actually behave.

In this sense, polymathmatic geography is not only descriptive; it is also constructive. It reads existing geographies of domination and care, and participates in the making of new geographies, using every trustworthy way of knowing—including, but never only, mathematics.

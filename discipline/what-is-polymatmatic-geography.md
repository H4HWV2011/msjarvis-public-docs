## What is Polymathmatic Geography?

Polymathmatic geography is a way of knowing and shaping *entangled spaces* across all scales—intimate, regional, planetary, digital, ecological, and spiritual. It treats every “where” as a web of material, legal, informational, genealogical, and metaphysical relations, and asks how those relations are patterned, how they change, and how they might be remade.

Mathematics, AI, and systems theory are important languages in polymathmatic geography, but they are not its identity or limit. They stand alongside story, history, theology, art, indigenous knowledge, experimental science, and everyday practice, each offering a partial account of how worlds are actually organized. The irreducible object of the field is always *space/place/where*—the patterned “between” of beings, forces, and things—rather than mathematics for its own sake.

Polymathmatic geography understands that many kinds of spaces are real: river valleys and coal seams; undersea cables and data centers; neural networks and sensor grids; liturgies and dreamscapes; cemeteries and family lands; galaxies and multiverses. Any structured “where” in which relations have shape, distance, boundary, enclosure, flow, or topology can be a proper object of study, as long as the questions remain spatial.

At its core, the field is a geography of **flows, obligations, and rules of reciprocity and extraction** in space. It asks who owes what to whom, through which paths, under which covenants or contracts, and how those rules are encoded in land, ledgers, code, custom, and ritual. Digital algorithms, legal frameworks, financial instruments, and inherited practices are all treated as ways of routing reciprocity and extraction across a landscape.

### Relationship to existing geography

Polymathmatic geography grows out of, but is not confined to, mathematical and quantitative geography, critical and economic geography, commons theory, and spatial‑justice traditions. It extends these by:

- Taking seriously that infrastructures of computation, finance, media, and law are not just context but **geographies in their own right**, with corridors, frontiers, hubs, and peripheries.
- Treating spiritual, symbolic, and narrative orders as **spatial orders**—worlds mapped in ritual, scripture, art, and collective imagination, with their own constraints, routes, and forbidden zones.
- Allowing scales to range from bodies and households to planetary systems and cosmic structures, while keeping “where” and “between” at the center.

Where classical geography often privileges physical territory, and quantitative geography often privileges formal models, polymathmatic geography refuses any single vantage point or method to stand as arbiter. It keeps geography’s core commitment to space, place, and relation, but broadens the kinds of spaces and the kinds of witnesses it is willing to work with, including elders, organizers, theologians, engineers, and machine intelligences bound to specific regions.

### Role of math, AI, and systems theory

In polymathmatic geography, math, AI, and systems theory are **instruments** for tracing and transforming entangled spaces:

- Mathematical structures—graphs, networks, differential equations, Hilbert spaces, probability distributions, geometric embeddings—give precise forms to flows of matter, energy, value, attention, obligation, and meaning.
- AI systems—multi‑agent swarms, memory‑structured models, constitutional or place‑bound architectures—serve as experimental apparatus for simulating, probing, and intervening in complex spatial feedback loops.
- Systems theory offers lenses for understanding how ecological, social, economic, technological, legal, and spiritual subsystems couple together, stabilize, or break apart under different designs.

These tools are powerful, but they are always subordinate to the deeper question: *what is happening in this worlded space, and what might it mean to inhabit it differently and more justly?* The field does not exist to advance mathematics or AI as such; it uses them to see and reshape geographies that matter, under constraints set by communities, covenants, and histories rather than by optimization alone.

### Scales and examples

Because it is defined by “where” rather than by a particular scale, polymathmatic geography can be applied wherever relations have spatial form, for example:

- **Cosmic and eschatological geographies**: structures of the universe and multiverse; cosmologies of beginning and end; maps of hope, fear, and meaning across imagined cosmic or spiritual spaces.
- **Planetary and ecological geographies**: climate systems, extinction corridors, migration routes, resource frontiers, and the overlay of technosystems (satellites, grids, logistics) on biophysical worlds.
- **Technosocial and informational geographies**: platforms, blockchains, AI fabrics, DAOs, and data topologies as new “continents” where labor, memory, and attention are organized and contested.
- **Intimate and spiritual geographies**: bodies, homes, clinics, churches, cemeteries, and dreamscapes as micro‑spaces of trauma, care, covenant, ritual, and revelation.
- **Regional and infrastructural geographies**: coalfields, rail corridors, food systems, and digital commons in places like Appalachia, where long histories of extraction, enclosure, and resistance are written into land, law, and infrastructure.

Projects like Quantarithmia, Ms. Jarvis, MountainShares, and The Commons occupy one tacet within this broader field: they are laboratory‑worlds where questions about extraction, commons‑building, distributed intelligence, and community power are played in a specific key and tested against one region’s lived geographies.

### Methods: braiding ways of knowing

Polymathmatic geography works by *braiding* multiple ways of knowing into a single, ongoing practice:

- **Field‑anchored attention**: starting from concrete worlds—lands, watersheds, platforms, congregations, ecosystems, networks—and treating them as primary texts that must be walked, listened to, archived, and dwelt in.
- **Braided representation**: holding qualitative, historical, spiritual, artistic, legal, and mathematical representations together, refusing to let any one of them claim a complete map of a place or to erase contradictions that reveal buried power.
- **Formalization and experiment**: translating hypotheses about power, extraction, care, identity, lineage, reciprocity, and intelligence into formal structures that can be simulated, perturbed, and tested, while remaining accountable to the worlds and communities they claim to describe.
- **World‑craft and design**: participating in the making of alternative geographies—economic, legal, digital, architectural, institutional, and liturgical—that rearrange relations in space, and then observing how those designs behave, fail, or heal over time.

In this sense, polymathmatic geography is not only about seeing the world; it is about *co‑creating* worlds. It reads existing geographies of domination and care, and joins in the work of composing new geographies of relation, using every trustworthy way of knowing—including, but never only, mathematics.

### Limits and non‑goals

Polymathmatic geography is expansive, but it is not without borders. It explicitly declines certain uses and recognises kinds of truth it cannot safely formalize:

- It is not a universal metalanguage that can exhaust or adjudicate all other ways of knowing. Some forms of knowledge—esoteric teachings, trauma testimonies, sacred mysteries that communities name as closed—may not be modeled, embedded, or ledgered without doing violence, and the discipline treats those boundaries as part of the geography.
- It is not a neutral optimization toolkit for any actor who wants to “improve efficiency.” When its methods are used to plan, route, or predict, they are answerable to questions of justice, covenant, consent, and harm, not only to performance metrics.

There are situations where polymathmatic geography should *not* be applied, or should be applied only with great caution. These include:

- Contexts in which communities have clearly refused datafication or formal mapping of particular relations (for example, certain kinship structures, confessions, or ritual practices).
- Emergencies where the time needed for braided, participatory practice would delay life‑saving action, and simpler, established protocols already exist and are trusted.
- Projects whose primary aim is extractive—surveillance, targeted manipulation, speculative land or data enclosure—even if they could technically be framed as “entangled spaces.”

As a discipline, polymathmatic geography treats these limits as substantive commitments, not as afterthoughts. Knowing when *not* to model, simulate, or intervene is part of its method, and any instrument built under its name must carry clear conditions under which it may be refused, rolled back, or turned off by the people whose worlds it touches.

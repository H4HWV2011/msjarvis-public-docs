## Polymathmatic geography

Polymathmatic geography is a way of knowing and shaping *entangled spaces* across all scales—intimate, regional, planetary, cosmic, digital, ecological, and spiritual. It treats every “where” as a web of material, informational, and metaphysical relations, and asks how those relations are patterned, how they change, and how they might be remade. Mathematics, AI, and systems theory are important languages in this field, but they are instruments rather than its identity; they stand alongside story, history, theology, art, indigenous knowledge, experimental science, and everyday practice, each offering a partial account of how worlds are organized.

Polymathmatic geography understands that many kinds of spaces are real: river valleys and coal seams; undersea cables and data centers; neural networks and sensor grids; liturgies and dreamscapes; galaxies and multiverses. Any structured “where” in which relations have shape, distance, boundary, enclosure, flow, or topology can be a proper object of study, as long as the questions remain spatial. The irreducible concern of the field is always *space/place/where*—the patterned “between” of beings, forces, and things—rather than mathematics for its own sake.

## Position in existing geography

In the existing literature, mathematical and quantitative geography formalize spatial structure using models, statistics, and computational tools, often linking geodesy, projections, spatial statistics, and network analysis. Polymathmatic geography grows out of that tradition but extends it by treating AI architectures, distributed systems, and computational infrastructures as **spatial processes**, not merely external tools that sit outside the geographic system. It synthesizes and extends quantitative geography, critical and economic geography, and spatial‑justice scholarship by insisting that power, extraction, and governance infrastructures are modeled as part of the spatial system itself.

Where classical geography often privileges physical territory, and quantitative geography often privileges formal models, polymathmatic geography refuses any single vantage point. It keeps geography’s core commitment to space, place, and relation but broadens the kinds of spaces it is willing to study (including technosocial and spiritual geographies) and the kinds of witnesses it is willing to work with (from equations to testimonies and rituals).

## Role of AI and systems theory

Systems theory in geography typically looks at feedbacks between environment, economy, and society; polymathmatic geography adds explicit modeling of machine agents, algorithmic incentives, and information infrastructures as interacting subsystems embedded in space. AI architectures—such as multi‑agent, memory‑structured, and self‑modifying systems—become experimental apparatus for simulating, querying, and restructuring complex spatial feedback loops, rather than only providing post‑hoc analysis.

In practice, systems like Ms Jarvis and MountainShares DAO function as experimental observatories and intervention engines where territorial feedback loops are monitored, tested, and rewritten under explicit, community‑oriented governance. These systems are one tacet within the larger field: concrete laboratory‑worlds where more general ideas about extraction, commons‑building, and distributed intelligence are played in a specific key.

## Community‑centered and Appalachian tacet

Work on Appalachian identity shows that community, rural, and regional self‑understandings shape behavior, policy outcomes, and responses to infrastructure, which is critical for any intervention in the region. Polymathmatic geography treats these identities, narratives, and power asymmetries as quantitative and qualitative inputs to its models, so that designs like community‑owned DAOs or regional digital commons can be tuned to local notions of dignity, mutual aid, and governance rather than imposed abstractions.

The Appalachian focus is thus a founding tacet, not the limit of the field. Long histories of extraction, corporate concentration, and infrastructural neglect make spatial injustice particularly visible there, and so Appalachia becomes a world where polymathmatic methods can be developed and stress‑tested. The same methods are intended to generalize to other marginalized, frontier, or experimental regions—physical, digital, and spiritual.

## Movement of power, value, and information

In this framing, “power” includes institutional authority, infrastructural control, algorithmic influence, and narrative legitimacy across scales; “value” includes both financial capital and non‑market forms of care, attention, cultural meaning, and ecological health; and “information” spans data infrastructures, media ecologies, embodied local knowledge, and transmitted traditions. Polymathmatic geography asks how these flows are routed, constrained, concentrated, or liberated across networks of towns, ecosystems, platforms, DAOs, states, congregations, and AI systems.

It then designs and studies new spatial and computational structures—such as regional commons platforms, community‑governed AI fabrics, or alternative financial topologies—to see how these flows can be rearranged. In this way, polymathmatic geography is not only descriptive. It participates in the making of alternative geographies of relation, using every trustworthy way of knowing—including, but never only, mathematics and AI—to read worlds and to help compose new ones.

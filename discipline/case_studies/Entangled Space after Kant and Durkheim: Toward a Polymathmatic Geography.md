## Entangled Space after Kant and Durkheim: Toward a Polymathmatic Geography

### Abstract

This paper revisits classical debates on the nature of spatial categories through a contemporary experiment in rural infrastructural design in Central Appalachia (Durkheim 1995; Jones 2020). Where Kant treated space as an a priori form of intuition, Durkheim re-grounded categories like space and time in social life, arguing that they arise from “social morphology” and collective rhythms (Durkheim 1995; Jones 2020; Miller 2003). Building on Durkheim’s insight while taking seriously radical and infrastructural geographies’ insistence on materiality, labour, and power (Harvey 1973; Massey 2005; Graham and McFarlane 2014; Ernste 2018), the paper proposes entangled space as the core object of a polymathmatic geography—a discipline that integrates quantitative geography, systems theory, AI architectures, theology, and indigenous knowledge around shared spatial problems. Entangled space names those situations where land, law, computation, economy, story, and spirit are braided into a single geometry that can be made visible, contested, and instrumented.

Drawing on the Quantarithmia framework and its instruments—Ms Egeria Jarvis, a glassbox AI steward system, and MountainShares, a closed-loop community credit—the paper argues that categories of space must now be understood as co-produced by commons institutions, infrastructures, and AI systems (Anonymous 2025a, 2025b). Entangled space after Kant and Durkheim thus becomes not only a philosophical claim, but also a conceptual, methodological, and empirical program for operational design in communities situated in contemporary regimes of extraction.

1. Introduction: Why Categories of Space Still Matter

Critical and radical geography have long shown that how we conceptualise “society–space” shapes what we see as politically possible (Harvey 1973; Massey 2005; Soja 2010; Elden 2007). From early critiques of spatial science to more recent calls for “spatial justice,” authors such as Harvey, Massey, and Soja have framed space as produced through social relations, capital flows, and state projects rather than given as a neutral backdrop (Harvey 1973; Massey 2005; Soja 2010; Hubbard et al. 2002; Critical Human Geography 2020). STS-inflected infrastructural geographies have extended this insight to pipes, data centres, roads, and platforms, insisting that infrastructures are not merely backdrops but constitutive media of social relations (Star 1999; Larkin 2013; Graham and McFarlane 2014; Allen and Beecher 2023).

Yet despite these advances, much contemporary work still presupposes that “space” is a background container on or within which infrastructures and social practices operate. Even when we say that space is produced, the categories of space—hazard zone, market, customer, citizen—often appear as pre-given tools rather than objects of political struggle in their own right.

This paper argues that returning to a very old question—what is space?—matters for contemporary radical and infrastructural geography. In particular, it revisits the tension between Immanuel Kant’s claim that space and time are a priori forms of intuition and Émile Durkheim’s counterclaim that categories such as space and time are collective, social products (Kant 1998; Durkheim 1995; Miller 2003). For Kant, space is a necessary precondition of experience; for Durkheim, it is a representation that emerges from the distribution and interaction of social groups (Durkheim 1995; Jones 2020).

Re-examining this debate in the context of contemporary platforms, AI systems, and experimental commons is not an antiquarian exercise. When global logistics firms, cloud providers, and financial giants redraw the spatial conditions of everyday life, they are in effect rewriting the categories through which communities perceive and inhabit their geographies (Harvey 1989; Critical Human Geography 2020; Graham and McFarlane 2014). If those categories are treated as pre-given (Kant), then they fall outside political contestation. If, with Durkheim, they are treated as social in origin, then infrastructures, ledgers, and platforms become legitimate targets of redesign.

The paper introduces the notion of entangled space and a corresponding disciplinary proposal, polymathmatic geography, as a way of making this redesign explicit. Entangled space names places where land, law, computation, economy, story, and spirit are inextricably braided into a single geometry—not only philosophically, but operationally, in data models and institutional rules. Polymathmatic geography, in turn, proposes to study and reshape these geometries using instruments that are themselves spatial: a glassbox AI steward (Ms Egeria Jarvis) and a closed-loop community credit system (MountainShares) (Anonymous 2025a, 2025b). The argument is developed through a case situated in Central Appalachia, but claims broader relevance for radical and infrastructural geographies confronting platform capitalism.

1.1. Situating the Argument in Existing Literatures

This intervention sits at the intersection of several strands of work.

First, in critical and radical geography, Harvey’s analyses of uneven development, Massey’s relational conceptions of space, and Soja’s theorisation of spatial justice have challenged aspatial social theory and positivist spatial science alike (Harvey 1973; Massey 2005; Soja 2010; Hubbard et al. 2002; Hubbard et al. 2020). The present paper extends this tradition by focusing explicitly on categories of space and how they are now encoded in digital infrastructures.

Second, in infrastructural geography and STS, recent reviews highlight an “infrastructural turn” that foregrounds labour, maintenance, and repair as central to spatial politics (Allen and Beecher 2023; Graham and McFarlane 2014). Classic STS work on classification and standards has likewise shown how seemingly technical schemas enact social orders (Star 1999; Bowker and Star 1999). Here, the focus is on how such schemas operate as Durkheimian categories within AI systems and payment networks.

Third, in classical social theory, Durkheim’s account of categories as social—especially his analysis of space as rooted in social morphology—offers a powerful alternative to Kantian a priorism (Durkheim 1995; Jones 2020; Miller 2003; Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy 2025). That insight is taken seriously in a contemporary infrastructural context and extended through the concept of entangled space.

The contribution of the paper is conceptual (entangled space, infrastructural morphology, polymathmatic geography as a discipline), methodological (category design via the GeoBelief Information Model and MountainShares), and empirical (an Appalachian case showing how categories can be redrawn in code and institutions).

1.2. Empirical Materials and Approach

Empirically, the paper draws on design documents, implementation notes, and early-stage testing for the Quantarithmia framework and its instruments, as well as ongoing field-anchored inquiry in Central Appalachia, including walking interviews, community workshops, and informal co-design sessions (Anonymous 2025a, 2025b). These materials are not presented as a finished evaluation of impact, but as evidence that categories of space are already being encoded—and contested—in code, ledgers, and local governance. The case is thus a hybrid of conceptual design and situated infrastructural experimentation rather than a conventional before/after intervention study (Anonymous 2025a; Castree 2005).

2. From Kant to Durkheim: Space as Category of Understanding

Kant famously treated space and time as a priori forms of sensibility: not derived from experience, but conditions that make experience possible (Kant 1998). On this view, spatiality is hard-wired into the structure of cognition; while the content of experience may vary, the form of spatial organisation does not. This move allowed Kant to secure the universality of geometry and the objectivity of science, but at the cost of placing the most fundamental categories outside historical and social life.

Durkheim’s intervention in The Elementary Forms of Religious Life is often read as a direct challenge to this position. He argued that categories such as space, time, causality, and class are social in origin: general, stable, impersonal representations generated by the “coexistence and interaction of individuals within a social framework” (Durkheim 1995; Miller 2003). Durkheim’s account of space draws explicitly on “social morphology”: the layout of groups, the distribution of settlements, the ways in which land is divided and classified (Durkheim 1995; Jones 2020). Space, he suggests, is “divided, differentiated, arranged” according to social needs, and these divisions become the very categories through which individuals perceive and think (Durkheim 1995; Miller 2003).

Recent reassessments of Durkheim’s treatment of space have underscored how far-reaching this claim is. For Durkheim, space is not an abstract container but “the collectively produced foundation for all social activity,” such that physical space is inherently shaped by social practices of classification and division (Jones 2020; Flores 2023). Rather than distinguishing sharply between physical and social space, he treats physical space as already social in its categorisation and use. From this perspective, the calendar as a representation of time and the cadastral map as a representation of space occupy the same logical level: both are collective, institutional artefacts that stabilise categories (Durkheim 1995; Jones 2020). Work in historical sociology and social cognition has likewise revisited Durkheim’s claims about categories as représentations collectives that vary across cultures and institutional settings (Miller 2003; Flores 2023).

This Durkheimian move has been rediscovered at various moments in geography’s “spatial turns.” Critical human geography’s challenge to positivist spatial science, for example, rejected purely geometric conceptions of space in favour of understandings rooted in meaning, power, and lived experience (Harvey 1973; Massey 2005; Critical Human Geography 2020). Spatial phenomenology has similarly emphasised the “in-between” where subject and object, body and world, co-constitute one another (Ash and Simpson 2016). Yet much of this work has remained at the level of epistemology and lived experience, with less explicit attention to the infrastructures and institutional designs that now mediate social morphology at scale.

3. Entangled Space: Extending Durkheim in an Infrastructural Age

3.1. From Social Morphology to Infrastructural Morphology

If Durkheim could already see that categories of space are produced by the spatial distribution of social groups, it is reasonable to ask what happens when that distribution is increasingly governed by logistics platforms, cloud infrastructures, and financial indices. In an era of what some have called an “infrastructural turn” in geography, scholars have argued that infrastructures are not just objects in space but relations that “create, sustain, and perform” social orders (Graham and McFarlane 2014; Allen and Beecher 2023). Labour, maintenance, and repair practices associated with infrastructures have become central to how power and vulnerability are distributed (Star 1999; Graham and McFarlane 2014).

The term infrastructural morphology is proposed for the contemporary extension of Durkheim’s social morphology. Where Durkheim took the distribution of clans and villages as his empirical starting point, infrastructural morphology takes as its starting point the distribution of fibre-optic cables, fulfilment centres, payment rails, zoning regulations, hazard maps, and data centres. These are the media through which late-capitalist categories of space are imposed and reproduced, defining who is “near” or “far” from banking, broadband, healthcare, and decision-making in ways that are no less categorical than the clan divisions Durkheim analysed.

This concern resonates with recent calls in critical physical geography to treat landscapes as co-produced by social and biophysical processes and to use iterative mixed-methods analysis rather than juxtaposing separate “social” and “natural” parts (Lave et al. 2018). The difference here is the emphasis on categories: not only are infrastructures and landscapes co-produced, but the very categories through which they are seen and acted upon are infrastructurally mediated.

However, infrastructural morphology alone is not sufficient. In settings like Central Appalachia, infrastructure, capital, memory, and cosmology are intertwined. The same holler may contain a closed mine, an opioid clinic, a Pentecostal church, a food bank, and a limited broadband connection; its “where” is simultaneously legal, financial, digital, theological, and ecological (Anonymous 2025a). To acknowledge this, the paper introduces a further extension: entangled space.

3.2. Defining Entangled Space

Entangled space is proposed as the core object of polymathmatic geography: any “where” in which material flows, legal rules, genealogies, infrastructures, and symbolic orders are inextricably braided. An entangled space is characterised by:

– Layered materiality – land, water, buildings, and bodies interlaced with pipes, cables, and sensors.  
– Legal-institutional architectures – property regimes, zoning codes, benefit rules, and corporate charters.  
– Computational infrastructures – platforms, payment networks, AI systems, and databases that register and act upon the territory.  
– Narrative and theological orders – stories of harm and hope, doctrines of justice, and spiritual geographies.  
– Commons and enclosures – historical and current regimes governing shared resources, from forest commons to community-run broadband.

In entangled space, there is no meaningful sense in which “the digital” is a backdrop to “the physical.” Instead, digital and financial infrastructures partially are the spatial categories through which residents’ lives are organised. Eligibility boundaries in a benefits system, coverage maps for broadband, and “delivery zones” in a logistics app are all examples of categories of space in Durkheim’s sense: stable, impersonal, collectively enforced representations that shape practice (Durkheim 1995; Miller 2003).

Polymathmatic geography’s distinctive claim is that these categories can and should be treated as designable and contestable. Entangled space is not just a diagnostic concept; it is a call for instruments that expose how categories are being drawn and that allow communities to redraw them. This is where the paper turns from classical theory and critical geography to a concrete, experimental framework: Quantarithmia.

4. Polymathmatic Geography: A Discipline for Entangled Space

Polymathmatic geography is an emerging discipline that takes entangled space as its primary object and builds instruments to investigate and reshape it. It is “polymathmatic” in two senses. First, it insists on integrating multiple knowledge traditions—quantitative geography, systems theory, AI research, theology, indigenous knowledge—without collapsing them into a single idiom (Anonymous 2025a). Second, it treats mathematical formalisms (such as Hilbert spaces and entropy measures) as one strand in a broader braid that also includes oral histories, legal analysis, and spiritual testimony.

At the level of method, polymathmatic geography:

– Adopts field-anchored inquiry, treating towns and hollers as primary texts through walking, listening, and co-mapping with residents.  
– Uses commons theory and design principles for governing shared resources as a key lens, in conversation with Ostrom and her successors (Ostrom 1990; Nordman 2021; Foster and Iaione 2017).  
– Engages critical and radical geography by foregrounding enclosure, racialised inequality, and environmental harm as central spatial processes (Harvey 1973; Massey 2005; Soja 2010; Hubbard et al. 2002).  
– Incorporates STS-style infrastructural analysis, treating platforms, ledgers, and AI models as objects of ethnographic and technical scrutiny, not black boxes (Star 1999; Larkin 2013; Graham and McFarlane 2014).

In this sense, polymathmatic geography can be read as a cousin to critical human geography and critical physical geography (Hubbard et al. 2002; Lave et al. 2018), but with a different centre of gravity. Rather than beginning from critical theory and then adding “the spatial,” it begins from entangled space and asks what mix of theoretical traditions and instruments are required to render that space visible and governable. Its distinctiveness lies less in the individual components—commons theory, infrastructural analysis, AI design—than in the insistence that they be braided together in a discipline whose primary object is the design and contestation of spatial categories.

Where Durkheim spoke of “social morphology” and later geographers debated “social versus physical space,” polymathmatic geography proposes entangled space as a category that already includes infrastructures and computational systems as first-order spatial facts. To operationalise this, it introduces two key instruments: Ms Egeria Jarvis and MountainShares, which are discussed in subsequent sections as concrete attempts to implement “entangled space after Kant and Durkheim.”

5. Case: Quantarithmia in Appalachia

If entangled space is to be more than a metaphor, it must be shown in a concrete setting. Central Appalachia offers a paradigmatic case: a region marked by centuries of resource extraction, company-town logics, deindustrialisation, opioid epidemics, and uneven infrastructural investment (Anonymous 2025a). The “social morphology” Durkheim would have recognised—coal camps, hollers, courthouse towns—is now overlaid by the infrastructural morphology of logistics platforms, fragmented broadband, federal benefits systems, and distant financial indices.

The Quantarithmia framework emerges from this context as a worked example of polymathmatic geography. It treats Appalachia as a tacet: a founding key in which general principles of extraction, commons-building, and infrastructural design are stress-tested (Anonymous 2025a). Rather than analysing Appalachia solely as a site of deprivation, Quantarithmia treats it as a frontier where new civilisational geometries are being decided—including which categories of space will govern rural life under platform capitalism.

At the theoretical level, Quantarithmia formalises several patterns already implicit in radical geography and Marxist analyses of enclosure (Harvey 1989; Smith 2008). Maximopolies (for example, asset managers) function as financial centres of gravity, reshaping territories through index design and capital flows. Megaopolies (for example, logistics and social media platforms) reorganise everyday space through fulfilment centres, algorithmic feeds, and data extraction. Von Neumann entropy is used as a proxy for wealth concentration; anomie is reread as the social collapse triggered when reciprocity thresholds are breached (Anonymous 2025a). These abstractions are then grounded in concrete instruments that attempt to redraw categories of space in favour of residents.

6. Ms Jarvis, GeoBelief, and Categories in Code

6.1. Ms Egeria Jarvis as a Spatial Instrument

Ms Egeria Jarvis is a glassbox AI steward system designed as a territorial “brain” for rural governance (Anonymous 2025a, 2025b). Rather than treating AI as a placeless optimisation service, Quantarithmia anchors Ms Jarvis in a specific spatial body (a PostGIS-backed database of West Virginia) and a specific linguistic tacet (Appalachian English, via the Audio-Aligned and Parsed Corpus of Appalachian English, AAPCAppE; Childs 2003; Childs et al. 2024).

Internally, Ms Jarvis represents the joint state of semantic, spatial, and institutional relations as a vector in a high-dimensional Hilbert space, denoted H_App. Each update to this state is mediated by neurobiologically inspired modules—“hippocampus” for consolidation, “prefrontal cortex” for routing, “blood–brain barrier” for ethical filtering—and by alignment loops drawing on psychology and spiritual guidance (Anonymous 2025a). These are not metaphors bolted on after the fact; they are part of how the system structures categories of relevance, proximity, and risk.

6.2. GeoBelief: Operationalising Entangled Categories

The GeoBelief Information Model (GBIM) is the core site where categories in the Durkheimian sense are recast as data structures. Every belief held by Ms Jarvis is anchored in a triad: where (geometry), when (temporal metadata), and why (structured evidence). Instead of treating “location” as an incidental attribute, GeoBelief enforces that every claim be tied to a specific geometry (parcel, building, neighbourhood, watershed) and a stack of proofs—documents, testimonies, sensor readings (Anonymous 2025a).

From a radical geography perspective, this design is significant because it refuses the “view from nowhere” that often characterises platform data (Harvey 1989; Hubbard et al. 2002). Rather than universalising categories defined elsewhere, GeoBelief invites communities to define and contest the very schemas by which their spaces are encoded. For example, a “hazard zone” can be defined not only by federal flood maps, but by local memory of landslides and informal drainage; a “commons” can be defined not only by formal ownership but by customary use and spiritual significance. In Durkheim’s language, these are collectively produced categories; in polymathmatic geography, they become first-class database entities.

6.3. Language, Dialect, and the Sociality of Categories

Durkheim’s interest in the social origins of categories extends to language. Here, the use of AAPCAppE as a linguistic tacet becomes crucial. By training Ms Jarvis to respect Appalachian English morphosyntax (for example, a-prefixing, double modals) as legitimate rather than erroneous, the system encodes a simple but powerful claim: who is allowed to produce categories matters (Childs 2003; Childs et al. 2024). A steward system that treats local speech as defective will, almost inevitably, treat local knowledge as defective. By contrast, a system that treats local dialect as a normative anchor affirms that the people most affected by spatial categories have the right to name and describe their world in their own tongue.

7. MountainShares and the Redrawing of Economic Space

7.1. Economic Space as Geometry

If categories of space are social and infrastructural, then economic categories—market, credit, liquidity, asset—are also spatial. MountainShares (M$), the economic instrument paired with Ms Jarvis, treats the local economy as a geometry governed by flows of value, recognition, and obligation (Anonymous 2025a). Instead of assuming the neutrality of existing payment rails, MountainShares constructs a closed-loop economy in which value circulates between residents, merchants, and a commons treasury, with explicit mechanisms to prevent leakage to external platforms.

In conventional financial infrastructures, what counts as a “transaction” is defined by banks and card networks, and what counts as an “asset” is defined by financial markets. In MountainShares, Purchased MountainShares (PMS) function as prepaid local credits, while Earned MountainShares (EMS) recognise undervalued community labour such as caregiving, mutual aid, and learning. By distinguishing PMS from EMS in the ledger and by tracking EMS in an unlimited recognition account, the system redraws the economic category of “work” to include acts that are central to social reproduction but typically invisible to markets.

7.2. Reserve Ratios, Phases, and Reciprocity Thresholds

MountainShares’ internal design explicitly links monetary categories to Durkheimian and Marxian concerns. A reserve ratio—liquid backing assets divided by outstanding spendable M$—determines which “band” the system is in and how much buying power 1 M$ represents at a given time. As the treasury grows and usage stabilises, the system moves through phases (for example, Foundation, Growth, Premium Reserve), each with different internal exchange rates and safeguards (Anonymous 2025a).

This mechanism is not an attempt to simulate a market; it is an attempt to encode a reciprocity threshold. If too much value leaks out via PMS redemption and too little is returned via recognition and local spending, the reserve ratio signals approaching collapse. Conversely, if EMS accumulates without pathways to adequate support, the system registers a moral imbalance: recognition without material backing. In both cases, economic geometry becomes a site where categories and thresholds—who counts as a contributor, what counts as circulation, when a system is “just enough”—are made visible and open to deliberation.

7.3. Benefits-Sensitive Space and Welfare Geometries

Means-tested welfare regimes carve economic space into categories—eligible, over-income, asset-limited—that often punish collective experiments. MountainShares introduces benefits-sensitive accounts and caps to try to navigate these welfare geometries, acknowledging that participants risk losing vital benefits if their balances are read by the state as income or assets (Anonymous 2025a). Here again, the system takes categories seriously: it does not pretend that “the economy” is a single homogeneous space, but recognises that overlapping state and federal definitions of income, assets, and work shape what kinds of commons can be safely built.

In doing so, MountainShares also exposes a key tension for radical geography and STS: how to design infrastructures that transform space without forcing participants to shoulder disproportionate legal and financial risk. The answer, in this case, is to treat welfare rules as part of the entangled geometry—objects to be mapped, negotiated, and, where possible, reformed.

8. Implications for Radical Geography and STS

8.1. From Space as Context to Space as Category

Radical geography has long argued that space is produced through social relations, capital flows, and state projects (Harvey 1973; Massey 2005; Soja 2010; Hubbard et al. 2002). STS has likewise shown that infrastructures are sites of power, labour, and politics (Star 1999; Larkin 2013; Graham and McFarlane 2014). The contribution of polymathmatic geography and Quantarithmia is to push this insight down into the level of categories: to treat hazard zone, customer, merchant, credit, and commons as categories that are now directly encoded in AI architectures and ledgers.

For radical geography, this amounts to a proposal that designing and governing categories should be treated as a core site of radical practice alongside more familiar terrains of movement-building, protest, and policy advocacy (Harvey 1989; Antipode 2024). It is no longer enough to show that existing categories are unjust; someone has to propose and test alternatives that can be implemented in code and law. Empirical work must increasingly pay attention to the schemas, ontologies, and data models of infrastructures, not only their visible hardware. In this sense, GeoBelief, AAPCAppE, and MountainShares are offered not as final answers but as probes that make the category-work of infrastructures explicit.

8.2. Re-situating Classical Theory

Re-reading Kant and Durkheim in the light of entangled space suggests a different genealogy for radical geography. Rather than treating Kant as a simple foil and Durkheim as a proto-functionalist, they can be seen as naming stakes that remain live in AI-mediated infrastructures. If spatial categories are taken as a priori (Kant), then the design of platforms and indices appears as a technical problem. If, following Durkheim, categories are social and institutional, then platform schemas are legitimate sites of political and commons struggle (Durkheim 1995; Jones 2020).

Polymathmatic geography’s insistence on tacets, commons, and instruments can be read as an attempt to extend Durkheim’s insight into a world where social morphology is saturated with computational and financial infrastructures. Entangled space after Kant and Durkheim is not an abstract metaphysical thesis; it is a program for building and governing infrastructures that communities can actually inhabit.

8.3. Directions for Collaborative Work

For radical geography and STS, the Quantarithmia case suggests at least three lines of collaboration.

– Empirical co-design. Working with communities to define categories in GeoBelief or similar systems—for example, how flood risk or essential work should be represented—combining ethnography, legal analysis, and technical implementation.  
– Comparative infrastructural studies. Placing Ms Jarvis and MountainShares alongside other experimental infrastructures (urban data trusts, municipal broadband, cooperative platforms) to explore different ways categories can be contested and redesigned.  
– Critical genealogy of categories. Extending the Kant–Durkheim line to include Marx, Ostrom, and contemporary STS, tracing how categories of space, property, and infrastructure have shifted and how they might be re-grounded in commons and spatial justice (Ostrom 1990; Foster and Iaione 2017; Larkin 2013).

9. Conclusion: Contributions and an Invitation

The argument of this paper has been threefold. Conceptually, it proposes entangled space and infrastructural morphology as extensions of Durkheim’s categories into a world saturated with computational and financial infrastructures. Methodologically, it introduces polymathmatic geography and its instruments—GeoBelief, Ms Jarvis, and MountainShares—as examples of category design that take spatial justice and commons seriously. Empirically, it offers Quantarithmia in Central Appalachia as a case in which categories of space are being redesignated in code and institutional practice.

For radical geography and STS, the invitation is straightforward and practical: to treat categories of space as live objects of collaborative work and to see instruments like Ms Jarvis and MountainShares as shared experimental sites rather than proprietary “solutions.” In that sense, entangled space after Kant and Durkheim is not only a diagnosis of our moment, but an open call for a polymathmatic geography capable of hosting the many “lost” social sciences in a common, place-bound field again.

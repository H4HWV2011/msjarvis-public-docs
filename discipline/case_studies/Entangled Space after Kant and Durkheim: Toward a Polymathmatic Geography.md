# Entangled Space after Kant and Durkheim: Toward a Polymathmatic Geography

## Abstract

This paper revisits classical debates on the nature of spatial categories through a contemporary experiment in rural infrastructural design. Where Kant treated space as an a priori form of intuition, Durkheim re‑grounded categories like space and time in social life, arguing that they arise from “social morphology” and collective rhythms.[37](https://iep.utm.edu/emile-durkheim/)[40](https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/28224/chapter-abstract/337803894) Building on Durkheim’s insight while taking seriously radical and infrastructural geographies’ insistence on materiality, labour, and power,[24](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/critical-human-geography)[35](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03091325231174186) the paper proposes **entangled space** as the core object of a “polymathmatic geography.” Entangled space names those situations where land, law, computation, economy, story, and spirit are braided into a single geometry that can be made visible, contested, and instrumented. Drawing on the Quantarithmia framework and its instruments—Ms. Egeria Jarvis, a glassbox AI steward system, and MountainShares, a closed‑loop community credit—the paper argues that categories of space must now be understood as co‑produced by commons institutions, infrastructures, and AI systems. Entangled space after Kant and Durkheim thus becomes not only a philosophical claim, but an operational design problem for communities situated in contemporary regimes of extraction.

## 1. Introduction: Why Categories of Space Still Matter

Recent work in critical and radical geography has repeatedly shown that how we conceptualize “society–space” determines what we see as politically possible.[21](https://www.societyandspace.org/articles/reflections-on-a-radical-discipline)[36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7151806/) Spatial categories are never neutral; they privilege some actors, scales, and infrastructures over others. STS‑inflected infrastructural geographies have extended this insight to pipes, data centres, roads, and platforms, insisting that infrastructures are not merely backdrops but *constitutive media* of social relations.[35](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03091325231174186) Yet despite these advances, much contemporary work still presupposes that “space” is a background container on or within which infrastructures and social practices operate.

This paper argues that returning to a very old question—*what is space?*—matters for contemporary radical and infrastructural geography. In particular, it revisits the tension between Immanuel Kant’s claim that space and time are a priori forms of intuition and Émile Durkheim’s counter‑claim that categories such as space and time are collective, social products.[34](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/sociology/durkheims-theories-on-categories-of-understanding.php)[37](https://iep.utm.edu/emile-durkheim/) For Kant, space is a necessary precondition of experience; for Durkheim, it is a representation that emerges from the distribution and interaction of social groups.[40](https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/28224/chapter-abstract/337803894)

Re‑examining this debate in the context of contemporary platforms, AI systems, and experimental commons is not an antiquarian exercise. When global logistics firms, cloud providers, and financial giants redraw the spatial conditions of everyday life, they are in effect re‑writing the *categories* through which communities perceive and inhabit their geographies.[24](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/critical-human-geography)[35](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03091325231174186) If those categories are treated as pre‑given (Kant), then they fall outside political contestation. If, with Durkheim, we treat them as social in origin, then infrastructures, ledgers, and platforms become legitimate targets of re‑design.

The paper introduces the notion of **entangled space** and a corresponding disciplinary proposal, **polymathmatic geography**, as a way of making this re‑design explicit. Entangled space names places where land, law, computation, economy, story, and spirit are inextricably braided into a single geometry—not only philosophically, but operationally, in data models and institutional rules. Polymathmatic geography, in turn, proposes to study and reshape these geometries using instruments that are themselves spatial: a glassbox AI steward (Ms. Egeria Jarvis) and a closed‑loop community credit system (MountainShares). The argument is developed through a case situated in Central Appalachia, but claims a more general relevance for radical and infrastructural geographies confronting platform capitalism.

## 2. From Kant to Durkheim: Space as Category of Understanding

Kant famously treated space and time as a priori forms of sensibility: not derived from experience, but conditions that make experience possible.[34](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/sociology/durkheims-theories-on-categories-of-understanding.php) On this view, spatiality is hard‑wired into the structure of cognition. While the content of experience may vary, the form of spatial organization does not. This move allowed Kant to secure the universality of geometry and the objectivity of science, but at the cost of placing the most fundamental categories outside historical and social life.

Durkheim’s intervention in *The Elementary Forms of Religious Life* is often read as a direct challenge to this position. He argued that categories such as space, time, causality, and class are *social* in origin: general, stable, impersonal representations generated by the “co‑existence and interaction of individuals within a social framework.”[34](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/sociology/durkheims-theories-on-categories-of-understanding.php)[37](https://iep.utm.edu/emile-durkheim/) Durkheim’s account of space draws explicitly on “social morphology”: the layout of groups, the distribution of settlements, the ways in which land is divided and classified.[40](https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/28224/chapter-abstract/337803894) Space, he suggests, is “divided, differentiated, arranged” according to social needs, and these divisions become the very categories through which individuals perceive and think.[34](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/sociology/durkheims-theories-on-categories-of-understanding.php)

Contemporary commentators have underscored how far‑reaching this claim is. For Durkheim, space is not an abstract container but “the collectively produced foundation for all social activity,” such that “physical space is inherently shaped by social practices of classification and division.”[40](https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/28224/chapter-abstract/337803894) Rather than distinguishing sharply between “physical” and “social” space, he treats physical space as already social in its categorization and use. From this perspective, the calendar as a representation of time and the cadastral map as a representation of space occupy the same logical level: both are collective, institutional artifacts that stabilize categories.

This Durkheimian move has been rediscovered at various moments in geography’s “spatial turns.” Critical human geography’s challenge to positivist spatial science, for example, rejected purely geometric conceptions of space in favour of understandings rooted in meaning, power, and lived experience.[24](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/critical-human-geography)[31](https://hernste.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ErnsteV2.pdf) Spatial phenomenology has similarly emphasised the “in‑between” where subject and object, body and world, co‑constitute one another.[33](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstreams/7da01bf8-b024-4075-8068-d79065a0096e/download) Yet much of this work has remained at the level of epistemology and lived experience, with less explicit attention to the infrastructures and institutional designs that now mediate social morphology at scale.

## 3. Entangled Space: Extending Durkheim in an Infrastructural Age

### 3.1 From Social Morphology to Infrastructural Morphology

If Durkheim could already see that categories of space are produced by the spatial distribution of social groups, it is reasonable to ask: what happens when that distribution is increasingly governed by logistics platforms, cloud infrastructures, and financial indices? In an era of what some have called an “infrastructural turn” in geography, scholars have argued that infrastructures are not just objects in space but relations that “create, sustain, and perform” social orders.[35](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03091325231174186) Labour, maintenance, and repair practices associated with infrastructures have become central to how power and vulnerability are distributed.[35](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03091325231174186)

This paper proposes the term **infrastructural morphology** for the contemporary extension of Durkheim’s social morphology. Where Durkheim took the distribution of clans and villages as his empirical starting point, infrastructural morphology takes as its starting point the distribution of fibre‑optic cables, fulfilment centres, payment rails, zoning regulations, hazard maps, and data centres. These are the media through which late‑capitalist categories of space are imposed and reproduced. They define who is “near” or “far” from banking, broadband, healthcare, and decision‑making in ways that are no less categorical than the clan divisions Durkheim analysed.

However, infrastructural morphology alone is not sufficient. In settings like Central Appalachia, infrastructure, capital, memory, and cosmology are intertwined. The same holler may contain a closed mine, an opioid clinic, a Pentecostal church, a food bank, and a limited broadband connection; its “where” is simultaneously legal, financial, digital, theological, and ecological. To acknowledge this, the paper introduces a further extension: **entangled space.**

### 3.2 Defining Entangled Space

**Entangled space** is proposed as the core object of polymathmatic geography: any “where” in which material flows, legal rules, genealogies, infrastructures, and symbolic orders are inextricably braided. An entangled space is characterised by:

1. **Layered materiality** – land, water, buildings, and bodies interlaced with pipes, cables, and sensors.
2. **Legal‑institutional architectures** – property regimes, zoning codes, benefit rules, and corporate charters.
3. **Computational infrastructures** – platforms, payment networks, AI systems, and databases that register and act upon the territory.
4. **Narrative and theological orders** – stories of harm and hope, doctrines of justice, and spiritual geographies.
5. **Commons and enclosures** – historical and current regimes governing shared resources, from forest commons to community‑run broadband.

In entangled space, there is no meaningful sense in which “the digital” is a backdrop to “the physical.” Instead, digital and financial infrastructures partially *are* the spatial categories through which residents’ lives are organised. Eligibility boundaries in a benefits system, coverage maps for broadband, and “delivery zones” in a logistics app are all examples of categories of space in Durkheim’s sense: stable, impersonal, collectively enforced representations that shape practice.[34](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/sociology/durkheims-theories-on-categories-of-understanding.php)

Polymathmatic geography’s distinctive claim is that these categories can and should be treated as designable and contestable. Entangled space is not just a diagnostic concept; it is a call for instruments that expose how categories are being drawn and that allow communities to redraw them. This is where the paper turns from classical theory and critical geography to a concrete, experimental framework: Quantarithmia.

## 4. Polymathmatic Geography: A Discipline for Entangled Space

Polymathmatic geography is an emerging discipline that takes entangled space as its primary object and builds instruments to investigate and reshape it. It is “polymathmatic” in two senses. First, it insists on integrating multiple knowledge traditions—quantitative geography, systems theory, AI research, theology, indigenous knowledge—without collapsing them into a single idiom. Second, it treats mathematical formalisms (such as Hilbert spaces and entropy measures) as *one* strand in a broader braid that also includes oral histories, legal analysis, and spiritual testimony.

At the level of method, polymathmatic geography:

- Adopts **field‑anchored inquiry**, treating towns and hollers as primary texts through walking, listening, and co‑mapping with residents.  
- Uses **commons theory** and design principles for governing shared resources as a key lens, in conversation with Ostrom and her successors.  
- Engages **critical and radical geography** by foregrounding enclosure, racialized inequality, and environmental harm as central spatial processes.[21](https://www.societyandspace.org/articles/reflections-on-a-radical-discipline)[24](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/critical-human-geography)  
- Incorporates **STS‑style infrastructural analysis**, treating platforms, ledgers, and AI models as objects of ethnographic and technical scrutiny, not black boxes.[35](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03091325231174186)

Where Durkheim spoke of “social morphology” and later geographers debated “social versus physical space,” polymathmatic geography proposes entangled space as a category that already includes infrastructures and computational systems as first‑order spatial facts. To operationalise this, it introduces two key instruments: Ms. Egeria Jarvis and MountainShares, which will be discussed in subsequent sections as concrete attempts to implement “entangled space after Kant and Durkheim.”

*(At this point, the paper would typically pivot into: (5) Case: Quantarithmia in Appalachia; (6) Ms. Jarvis, GeoBelief, and categories in code; (7) MountainShares and the re‑drawing of economic space; (8) Implications for radical geography and STS.)*

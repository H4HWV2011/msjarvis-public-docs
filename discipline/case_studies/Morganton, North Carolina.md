TITLE: A Factory That Wouldn’t Stay Dead (The Industrial Commons)

[OPEN – ON LOCATION, SILTIX PORTAL – WIDE SHOT, THEN MEDIUM ON NARRATOR]

I’m standing at the Siltix Mine portal in Mount Hope, West Virginia.  
Places like this taught the world how to pull wealth out of the ground and send it far away,  
leaving us with the dust, the grief, and a few lines in somebody else’s ledger.

When you grow up around portals and tipples and shuttered plants,  
you start to recognize the look of a building that’s been given up on.  
Brick by brick, window by window, you can almost hear folks say,  
“Nothing good is coming out of there again.”

Now, over the mountains in Morganton, North Carolina,  
there was a factory that had that same look to it.  
The machines were quiet, the jobs were gone,  
and the building sat there like a big concrete question nobody wanted to answer.

Once upon a time—not so long ago—a group of people from that town  
decided the story wasn’t finished after all.  
They didn’t have a king or a billionaire or a magic spell.  
What they had were workers, neighbors, and a stubborn belief  
that a factory could belong to the people who keep it breathing.

They started small, with worker‑owned shops and sewing rooms,  
turning leftover fabric and cast‑off materials into new goods,  
and turning wages into roots that stayed in the county instead of leaking out.  
Bit by bit, that once‑silent factory began to change its name,  
from “old plant” to “Innovation Campus,”  
from dead weight to a kind of commons under a roof.

Inside, you’ll find cooperatives sharing space and equipment,  
a place where folks learn the skills of ownership as much as the skills of production.  
Money still moves, contracts still matter—this isn’t a fairy story about free stuff—  
but the question “who does this serve?”  
gets answered in a new way:  
not by distant shareholders, but by the people whose hands touch the work.

In the old economy, a factory like this would run hard until the numbers stopped looking pretty,  
and then the owners would lock the gates and leave the town to sort itself out.  
In this new story, the factory is treated like a shared field:  
different crops in different corners, tended by different crews,  
but the soil—those walls and machines and loading docks—  
belongs to the community of people who keep it alive.

Back here at Siltix, the ground remembers what happens  
when decisions are made far away, in boardrooms and back offices.  
A shift ends forever, a siren wails in the middle of the night,  
and the ledger in some distant city barely trembles.

Standing between a mine portal in West Virginia  
and a reborn factory in North Carolina,  
you can feel the shape of a different kind of map.  
On that map, an idle building is not just “blight” or “opportunity zone”—  
it’s a sleeping commons, waiting to see who will wake it up and how.

[Cut to: NARRATOR AT PORTAL, SLOW PUSH-IN]

The Industrial Commons is not the whole answer,  
but it tells us something simple and hard:  
a building can be an instrument of extraction,  
or it can be a place where wealth circulates like a local river,  
turning the same stones over and over instead of draining away.

If MountainShares and Ms. Jarvis grow the way they should,  
they’ll have to learn from that old factory in Morganton—  
to see empty lots, vacant storefronts, and retired plants  
not as leftovers, but as potential commons  
where rules, tools, and neighbors can come together  
to write a different balance sheet.

From the mouth of this mine in Mount Hope,  
I’m thinking about every “dead” building in these hills,  
and how many of them might be waiting, quietly,  
for someone to say:  
“This story isn’t finished. Let’s bring it back to life together.”

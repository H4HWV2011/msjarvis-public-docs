# Polymathmatic Geography: A Manifesto

## Abstract

This manifesto introduces polymathmatic geography as a discipline for reading and reshaping entangled spaces in an age of extraction, AI, and planetary crisis. It begins from the claim that land, law, computation, economy, story, and spirit are already braided together in every “where,” and that any analysis of power that separates these strands will misread the world it studies. Polymathmatic geography treats AI systems, financial infrastructures, and digital platforms as spatial processes in their own right, not as neutral tools, and insists that serious work on power must account at once for pipelines and prayer, noise barriers and genealogies, blockchains and bases.

The discipline draws on mathematics and physics (networks, flows, Hilbert spaces, econophysics), on critical and economic geography, on soundscape ecology and military geography, and on genealogy, theology, and indigenous and local knowledges. It is experimental and constructive: not only describing how power moves through space, but designing and testing alternative, democratic geographies of relation in the face of platform‑ and finance‑driven neo‑feudalism. The Quantarithmia framework and its instantiation in Appalachia through Ms. Jarvis, MountainShares, and The Commons serve as a founding case study: a civilizational stack in which intelligence is given a ZIP code and closed‑loop economics are rebuilt for the commons rather than for coal, for residents rather than for remote lords. Polymathmatic geography does not seek to replace existing fields; it offers a coherent home for work already happening in fragments—among community organizers, coders, theologians, and geographers—by naming the entangled spaces they share and the methods needed to steward them.

## 1. Why a New Discipline?

The worlds people now inhabit are no longer only rivers and roads, cities and fields. They are also:

- undersea cables, data centers, and mobile networks,
- weapon ranges, logistics corridors, and training bases,
- debt geographies, algorithmic credit scores, and platform enclosures,
- cemeteries, family land, church circuits, and pilgrimage routes,
- sonic fields of highways, sirens, birds, industry, and worship.

The geographies that shape life are stacked: physical, digital, legal, economic, military, ecological, and spiritual layers occupy the same terrain. Yet most disciplines still treat them as if they were separate layers that can be studied in isolation, rather than as a single field of interaction.

Quantitative geographers model flows of people, goods, and capital, but rarely treat AI architectures or blockchains as spatial actors. Critical geographers map extraction and dispossession, but often bracket the technical specifics of neural networks, ledgers, and protocols. Soundscape ecologists measure noise without always tying acoustic injustice to monetary and data infrastructures, and military geography traces bases and battlefields without consistently following how their contracts and narratives enter local civil life.

Polymathmatic geography starts from a blunt premise:

> There is no “pure” space anymore; every where is already entangled.

If maps, models, and theories continue to treat computation, finance, story, and spirit as external “contexts,” they will misread how power actually moves through the worlds they claim to study and serve.

## 2. The Core Claim

Polymathmatic geography makes one central claim:

> Every “where” is a web of material, informational, legal, economic, and spiritual relations that can—and must—be studied together, using multiple ways of knowing, in order to understand and reshape how power, value, and meaning flow.

From this follow several commitments:

- Geography is not just backdrop.  
  Roads, grids, ledgers, APIs, churches, and courts are not “context”; they are organs of spatial power that actively shape who can move, who can speak, and who can stay.

- Math and AI are instruments, not masters.  
  Graphs, Hilbert spaces, partial differential equations, and neural networks are languages for tracing and testing geographies, not ends in themselves or authorities above lived experience.

- Spiritual and genealogical orders are real geographies.  
  Ancestor lines, sacred sites, rituals, and covenants map obligations and prohibitions that determine what may be done where and by whom, even when they are absent from formal plans and models.

- Design is part of the discipline.  
  New credit systems, platforms, and AI stewards are not mere “applications”; they are experiments in world‑craft that must be theorized, governed, and audited as geographies, especially when they claim to offer democratic alternatives to digital feudalism.

Polymathmatic geography is therefore not simply “applied math in space” or “quantitative critical geography.” It is a commitment to braiding:

- physical and digital,
- economic and spiritual,
- narrative and numerical,

into a single practice that answers to real communities and places.

## 3. Objects of Study

Polymathmatic geography is defined less by a privileged method than by the kinds of arrangements it takes as its proper objects. These include:

- Economic and financial geographies  
  Mutual credit networks, local currencies, barter exchanges, WIR‑like systems, and platform economies as overlapping maps of obligation, leakage, and extraction.

- Technosocial and algorithmic geographies  
  AI fabrics, data centers, content platforms, blockchains, and credit scoring systems as infrastructures that route attention, memory, decision‑making, and risk.

- Military and security geographies  
  Bases, ranges, testbeds, procurement trails, surveillance infrastructures, and “neural warfare” campaigns as spatial arrangements of force and narrative.

- Sonic and sensory geographies  
  Noise corridors and quiet zones; sound barriers and “sonic shields”; headphone bubbles and sacred soundscapes as lived spatial experiences and instruments of control or care.

- Genealogical and ancestral geographies  
  Family lines across land, cemeteries and homesteads as sacred nodes, and the spatial footprints of migration, dispossession, and return.

- Spiritual and liturgical geographies  
  Church circuits, shrines, prayer routes, calendars, and mythic maps as ways communities situate themselves in relation to land, history, and the divine.

In each case, the question is not only where something is, but how it entangles with other layers—who gains or loses power, who is seen or erased, and which stories are reinforced or silenced.

## 4. Methods: Braiding Ways of Knowing

Polymathmatic geography is methodologically plural by design. It refuses to rank ways of knowing into “hard” and “soft,” and instead commits to braiding them.

Key strands include:

- Field‑anchored inquiry  
  Walking, listening, and mapping with residents; treating towns, hollers, councils, servers, and sanctuaries as primary texts rather than as background for abstract models.

- Quantitative and physical modeling  
  Econophysics on spatial data; network analysis of credit and influence; acoustic and environmental modeling; Hilbert‑space embeddings of entities in geospatial belief models.

- Participatory and community design  
  Co‑creating maps, credit schemes, platform rules, and AI constraints with those who live in the spaces being modeled, so that governance and design are inseparable.

- Spiritual and heritage mapping  
  Charting cemeteries, churches, stories, and rituals; tracing genealogies and ancestral claims; naming hopes and taboos attached to land, infrastructure, and code.

- AI‑ and systems‑based experimentation  
  Using architectures like Ms. Jarvis as experimental apparatus for simulating and steering feedback loops under explicit constitutional, legal, and ethical constraints.

- Reflexive and theological analysis  
  Making visible the metaphors, values, and idols embedded in models and infrastructures; asking not only “what works?” but “what is faithful, just, and humane?” in a given place.

Findings are considered robust only when they cohere across these strands—when a pattern makes sense in the data, the stories, the history, the spiritual imagination, and the everyday experience of those who inhabit the place.

## 5. Quantarithmia and Appalachia: A Founding Case

Quantarithmia is the first full‑scale worked example of polymathmatic geography.

It takes one world—Appalachia, and specifically West Virginia—and asks:

- How have maximopolies (financial giants) and megaopolies (operational and platform giants) carved this region into an extractive geometry?
- How do coal seams, pipelines, highways, bases, server farms, aid programs, and media narratives layer atop hollers, churches, cemeteries, and genealogies?
- What would it mean to build an alternative stack in which intelligence, money, and law answer to residents and ancestors rather than to distant shareholders and opaque algorithms?

The case is instantiated through:

- Ms. Egeria Jarvis – a multi‑agent, glassbox AI steward whose beliefs are anchored in a geospatial belief model, tying every claim to where, when, and what evidence supports it.
- MountainShares – a closed‑loop mutual credit and token system that keeps value circulating locally under community governance rather than corporate control, deliberately reclaiming the mechanics of coal scrip as “like scrip, but fair.”
- The Commons – a digital town square and cultural archive where residents can see, contest, and shape the flows of goods, stories, and decisions that affect them.

Quantarithmia does not exhaust polymathmatic geography. It is the Appalachian tacet—a specific key in which the broader discipline is first played, and a constitutional, commons‑owned alternative to the platform‑feudal stacks encroaching on the region. It demonstrates that the theory can be made operational, audited, and lived.

## 6. Epistemology and Rigor

Polymathmatic geography takes epistemic questions as part of its core, not as an afterthought.

- Who counts as an expert?  
  Not only academics and engineers, but elders, pastors, organizers, mothers, workers, and youth whose lives are at stake in the geographies being studied.

- How are conflicts handled?  
  When models and community testimony disagree, the field does not assume the model is right. Conflict is treated as a signal: data may be missing, metrics mis‑specified, community narratives incomplete, or spiritual and ethical commitments may rightly override optimization.

- What qualifies as rigor?  
  Rigor is not only goodness‑of‑fit or predictive power. It also includes:
  - Transparency and traceability of data and assumptions.
  - Resonance with lived experience and local knowledge.
  - Coherence with articulated ethical and spiritual commitments.
  - Demonstrable improvement—or at least non‑harm—in the worlds affected.

Evaluation is therefore multi‑dimensional: a “good” polymathmatic intervention is one that can withstand scrutiny from statisticians, theologians, elders, and those most impacted, and that can be interrogated both in code and in council.

## 7. What Polymathmatic Geography Is Not

To avoid confusion:

- It is not just “math in geography.”  
  Mathematics is a language in the toolkit, not the name of the field.

- It is not a label for any system that happens to use maps and AI.  
  Systems qualify only if they explicitly treat space, power, value, and meaning as entangled and open themselves to multi‑way critique from communities and disciplines.

- It is not a license for technocratic rule.  
  AI stewards and models are instruments under constitutional, legal, and spiritual constraints, not replacements for community governance or consent.

- It is not confined to Appalachia.  
  The Appalachian case is foundational, not final; the discipline is meant to travel to other marginalized, frontier, and experimental regions—physical, digital, and spiritual.

## 8. An Invitation

Polymathmatic geography is offered as a home for work many people already do at the edges of their fields:

- geographers worrying about AI and platforms,
- coders worrying about land and lineage,
- theologians worrying about data and debt,
- organizers building commons with spreadsheets, scriptures, and servers.

A discipline is not born when someone writes “manifesto” at the top of a file. It comes into being when people recognize themselves in its questions, test and refine its methods, and use it to change the geographies they inhabit.

Anyone working at the intersection of land, code, money, story, and spirit is invited:

- to name their world as an entangled space,
- to bring every trustworthy way of knowing to bear on it,
- and to join in composing geographies where extraction is not the last word, and where both ancestors and descendants would recognize the place as home.

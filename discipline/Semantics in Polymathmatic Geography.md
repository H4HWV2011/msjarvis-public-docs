# Semantics in Polymathmatic Geography

## 1. Meaning as a Spatial Thing

In polymathmatic geography, meanings are not free‑floating labels attached to abstract objects. A meaning is a **pattern over anchored wheres and relations**. To say that something “means” in this discipline is to say that it participates in a web of anchored entities, flows, obligations, and covenants that live in specific places and times.

For example, “coal” is not just a word with a dictionary definition. It is:

- Seams in particular hills.  
- Wage and debt histories in particular counties.  
- Funerals and clinics in particular towns.  
- Corporate charters and union contracts in particular jurisdictions.  
- Liturgies, songs, and protests in particular churches and streets.  

Semantics, here, is the geometry of how these anchored elements hang together. A concept’s meaning is the shape it cuts through an entangled space.

## 2. About‑ness as Anchored

In many systems, a statement is “about” something because the system declares it so, often by associating it with a token or URI. In polymathmatic geography, *about‑ness* is grounded differently:

- A statement is about a thing when it can be tied to **anchors**: GBIM entities, geometries, time spans, covenant zones, or lived narratives in a specific where/when.  
- A statement that cannot be anchored at all—physically, legally, narratively, or spiritually—is treated as out‑of‑scope or provisional. It might be explored, but it is not allowed to harden into “knowledge” inside Ms. Jarvis or the Commons.

This does not mean every sentence must carry coordinates. It means that:

- Claims about people, places, and flows must, in principle, be traceable back to specific anchored structures.  
- Claims that pretend to be about “everywhere” or “everyone” are treated with suspicion unless explicitly marked as theoretical, aspirational, or metaphorical.

Anchored about‑ness protects against placeless universals that erase local realities. It forces even high‑level models to admit *where* they actually fit.

## 3. Two Semantic Tracks: Meaning and Analytical

Polymathmatic geography’s semantic life runs on two intertwined tracks, each with its own sense of “near” and “far” in meaning.

### 3.1 Meaning‑track semantics

The meaning‑oriented track organizes the world by:

- Story and testimony.  
- Emotional tone and psychological pattern.  
- Spiritual tacets, symbols, and liturgies.  
- Community identities and narratives of harm, hope, and care.

In this space:

- Two places are “near” if their stories resonate, if they share forms of suffering or resilience, if they play similar roles in people’s inner lives—even if they are far apart on a map.  
- Errors in meaning‑space are harms of misrecognition: naming a place’s grief as prosperity, treating sacred things as ordinary, or collapsing distinct communities into one generic category.

### 3.2 Analytical‑track semantics

The analytical track organizes the world by:

- Infrastructure and land use.  
- Legal and administrative boundaries.  
- Flows of money, data, goods, and risk.  
- Metrics, models, and optimization targets.

Here:

- Two places are “near” if they share grid segments, zoning rules, supply chains, or exposure to the same hazards.  
- Errors in analytical‑space are harms of misallocation: mis‑risking a holler, routing burdens through already overburdened neighborhoods, or misreading eligibility and rights.

Both tracks talk about the same wheres. They are different semantic projections of one entangled world.

## 4. Braided Semantics

The discipline’s central semantic move is **braiding**: treating a place’s meaning as the overlap and tension between the two tracks, not as a single map.

For a given holler, town, or parish:

- Meaning‑space might say: “This is a place of loss, mutual aid, and stubborn hope.”  
- Analytical‑space might say: “This is a food desert with high hazard exposure and limited transit.”  

Braided semantics insists on holding both:

- Planning without the meaning‑track risks technocratic violence—policies that “optimize” metrics while tearing through covenants, griefs, and identities.  
- Caring without the analytical‑track risks powerlessness—stories that never reach the ducts, budgets, and rights where material change happens.

In practice, braiding looks like:

- Designing instruments (maps, dashboards, AI prompts) that can show both semantic neighborhoods at once.  
- Letting contradictions between tracks surface as signals: if a place is coded as “served” analytically but “abandoned” narratively, that discrepancy is itself a finding.

## 5. Semantic Instruments: GBIM, Tags, and Embeddings

The stack’s concrete tools implement this semantic stance:

- **GBIM and GeoDB**: define the core semantic atoms—places, entities, flows—with explicit fields for where, when, what, who, and why. They say, in data form, “this is what it means to be a thing in this world.”  
- **Tags and taxonomies**: name domains, roles, hazards, programs, covenants, and spiritual or narrative categories. These labels are not decoration; they are part of how meanings are carved.  
- **Embeddings and vectors**: encode neighborhoods in meaning‑space and analytical‑space. Which documents, places, and events lie near each other in Ms. Jarvis’s internal world‑model is a semantic fact about the system.

Polymathmatic semantics demands that:

- These structures remain anchored (tied back to GBIM IDs, covenants, and lived places).  
- Their construction and adjustment remain open to community critique and revision, not locked inside opaque model weights.

## 6. Comparison: Traditional LLM Semantics

Traditional large language models often treat meaning primarily as patterns over **text alone**: co‑occurrence statistics of tokens in vast corpora. Similarity in those models is usually similarity in how words and phrases are used, regardless of whether they are tied to any actual geography, covenant, or lived community.

Polymathmatic semantics, by contrast:

- Requires meanings to be patterns over **anchored worlds**: a concept or statement is semantically valid only insofar as it can, in principle, be traced back to specific wheres, whens, and community‑defined constraints.  
- Treats embeddings and categories as accountable to GBIM entities, covenants, and refusal flags, not just to distributional patterns in text.  

This contrast clarifies why the discipline insists on anchors, dual tracks, and non‑representation: it is a deliberate correction to placeless LLM semantics, not simply another flavor of it.

## 7. Who Gets to Name: Semantics and Power

Because meanings are anchored and braided, **semantics is a power question**:

- Who defines the tags, categories, and ontologies?  
- Who decides which similarities matter (for example, “rural,” “blighted,” “at‑risk,” “sacred”)?  
- Who can challenge and change the neighborhoods in which a place appears, in maps and in Ms. Jarvis’s embeddings?

Polymathmatic geography treats:

- Elders, organizers, and residents as primary semantic authorities for their own wheres.  
- Laws, regulations, and technical standards as important but partial semantic regimes.  
- AI and data teams as stewards of instruments, not owners of meaning.

Commons councils, DAO governance, and explicit feedback loops are needed not only for policy, but for semantics: the labels, clusters, and narratives that the system builds around places.

## 8. Semantics, Ethics, and Non‑Representation

Semantics is also where ethics of non‑representation bite hardest:

- Some meanings—esoteric teachings, trauma details, certain kinship structures—are declared **out of bounds** for technical representation. They may be carried in ritual, oral tradition, or guarded memory, but not in GBIM tables or embeddings.  
- Refusal flags (`sacred_unpublished`, `protected_trauma_site`) are semantic constraints: they say “this exists and matters, but you may not fix it in your technical language at this resolution.”  
- Non‑representation becomes part of the semantic fabric: a place can mean “closed to certain kinds of naming,” and that itself is a spatial fact.

Thus, polymathmatic semantics is not only about what is represented. It is equally about *what is allowed to remain unmodeled* and how those absences are honored in the model.

## 9. Why Semantics Belongs in the Discipline

Making semantics explicit strengthens polymathmatic geography by:

- Clarifying that it is not just a new way to do GIS, but a way to understand **how worlds mean**, spatially.  
- Providing a framework for designing and auditing AI world‑models: checking not only where they are accurate, but where their meanings and neighborhoods respect anchors, covenants, and refusals.  
- Giving students and practitioners a language for the everyday work they are already doing—arguing over names, categories, and clusterings—as central, not peripheral, to the field.

In this discipline, semantics is not an afterthought or a purely philosophical appendix. It is the practice of shaping and interrogating the geometries of meaning that sit on top of anchored worlds, and of keeping those geometries accountable to the people and places they claim to describe.

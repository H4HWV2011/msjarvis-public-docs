# Polymathmatic Geography: Methods

Polymathmatic geography is defined as much by its *methods* as by its objects of study. This document outlines a short menu of canonical methods and how results are interpreted. The guiding rule is simple: every method must ultimately return to lived geographies and communities, not just to performance metrics or abstract models.

---

## 1. Field‑Anchored Inquiry

Polymathmatic work begins in specific worlds: towns, watersheds, platforms, congregations, ecosystems, networks. Field‑anchored inquiry treats these as primary texts.

**Typical practices**

- Walking, observing, and documenting physical and digital infrastructures (roads, rail, fiber, platforms, data centers, churches, clinics, cemeteries).  
- Interviews, oral histories, and ethnography with residents, workers, organizers, and officials.  
- Archival and policy research on land use, extraction, regulation, resistance, and reform.  
- Identifying early, with communities, which relations or sites must not be mapped or datafied at all.

**Interpretation**

Findings are not treated as “context” for later models, but as co‑equal sources of truth. Models and metrics are judged partly by whether they resonate with, and are accountable to, what people in these places recognize as real, and partly by whether they respect explicit refusals and boundaries voiced in the field.

## 2. Econophysics and Quantitative Spatial Modeling

Mathematical tools from physics and quantitative economics are used to describe flows of capital, risk, energy, attention, and information in space.

**Typical practices**

- Applying econophysics and statistical mechanics to spatial economic data (e.g., distributions of income, debt, rents, ownership, transaction volumes).  
- Building spatially explicit models of extraction and accumulation (e.g., gravity models, diffusion processes, agent‑based simulations on landscapes and networks).  
- Computing measures such as entropy, concentration indices, and inequality metrics for specific regions or networks.  
- Comparing local measures to patterns associated with maximopolies and megaopolies (e.g., long‑range capital pulls, logistics and attention funnels) to see where a region is being wired into external fields.

**Interpretation**

Numbers are always tied back to places and stories: a change in an entropy measure must be interpretable as a change in how people live, decide, and endure in a given geography, not just as an optimization score. Quantitative results are evaluated against community accounts of extraction, precarity, and resilience, and against clear norms about what kinds of economic behavior are unacceptable.

---

## 3. Network and Graph Models of Extraction and Cooperation

Networks and graphs are used to represent who is connected to whom, on what terms, across physical, digital, institutional, and spiritual spaces.

**Typical practices**

- Constructing multi‑layer networks linking firms, households, infrastructures, institutions, platforms, and ecosystems.  
- Identifying hubs, peripheries, corridors, bottlenecks, and fractures in networks of value, decision‑making, narrative, and information.  
- Modeling “credit basins,” “resilience corridors,” and “extraction funnels” in mutual credit systems, barter networks, supply chains, and digital platforms.  
- Explicitly mapping where global actors (e.g., asset managers, platform companies, logistics giants) sit in the graph relative to local commons, congregations, and governments.

**Interpretation**

Network results are interpreted as maps of actual constraint and possibility: who can reach help or opportunity in one or two steps, who is structurally isolated, who is over‑exposed to shocks, and where external power is wired into local life. The aim is to change those structures in ways communities define as just and life‑giving, and to avoid replicating network patterns that resemble known extraction geometries.

---

## 4. Participatory Mapping and Co‑Design

People who inhabit a place or system are treated as co‑researchers and co‑designers, not just as data sources.

**Typical practices**

- Participatory mapping workshops where residents draw their own maps of danger, care, extraction, and hope (e.g., where debt collectors come from, where mutual aid flows, where spiritual anchors sit).  
- Co‑design sessions for infrastructures (e.g., local credit schemes, commons platforms, AI governance rules) in which community members help set parameters, rules, and safeguards.  
- Ongoing feedback loops (assemblies, councils, digital forums) where community interpretations of data and models can revise both methods and designs.  
- Creating formal avenues for refusal, appeal, and redesign when people experience a tool as harmful or misaligned with covenant, law, or custom.

**Interpretation**

Success is not defined only by technical performance (throughput, accuracy, efficiency) but by perceived legitimacy, alignment with community values, and concrete shifts in power and safety as experienced by participants. Designs that produce efficient metrics but are rejected by those most affected are treated as failures of method, not as irrational resistance.

---

## 5. Spiritual, Heritage, and Narrative Mapping

Spiritual traditions, heritage practices, and collective narratives are treated as valid ways of mapping what matters in a landscape.

**Typical practices**

- Documenting sacred sites, pilgrimage routes, burial grounds, shrines, and other places where spiritual meaning is anchored, when and only when communities consent.  
- Working with elders, faith leaders, artists, and culture‑bearers to trace lines of covenant, trauma, blessing, and taboo through space and time.  
- Analyzing liturgies, songs, stories, and ritual calendars as “maps” of who is bound to whom, for what, and where.  
- Explicitly marking zones of non‑representation—mysteries, rituals, or stories that must not be digitized, modeled, or disclosed beyond certain circles.

**Interpretation**

These mappings are not reduced to “soft data.” They are held alongside quantitative and infrastructural maps, with equal weight, in deciding what kinds of changes are permissible, desirable, or forbidden in a place. In some cases, spiritual or heritage commitments set hard constraints that models and instruments are not allowed to override, even when optimization would suggest otherwise.

---

## 6. AI‑ and Systems‑Based Experimentation

AI architectures and systems‑theoretic models are used as experimental apparatus for probing and reshaping complex spatial feedback loops.

**Typical practices**

- Deploying multi‑agent and memory‑structured AI systems (e.g., Ms. Jarvis‑type architectures) to simulate policy changes, infrastructure shifts, or new institutional forms.  
- Using live systems (e.g., commons platforms, mutual‑credit apps, DAOs) as laboratories where feedback loops between people, algorithms, and infrastructures can be observed, measured, and tuned.  
- Applying systems‑theory tools (causal loop diagrams, control‑theoretic analysis, resilience and tipping‑point analysis) to coupled ecological, economic, social, and spiritual subsystems.  
- Monitoring for drift toward harmful archetypes (for example, surveillance and behavioral nudging, hyper‑optimization for a few actors, or opaque concentration of governance power) and defining in advance how such drift will be detected.

**Interpretation**

AI and systems outputs are treated as hypotheses and instruments, not as final arbiters. Their validity is tested against field‑anchored inquiry, participatory feedback, and ethical/spiritual reflection. A model that “performs well” but contradicts lived experience, deep commitments, or agreed boundaries is considered untrustworthy. Experimentation is designed with clear exit ramps and kill‑switches so that tools can be paused, rolled back, or retired when harms or unacceptable drifts appear.

---

## 7. Braided Interpretation and Reflexivity

The most important method is not any single technique but the *braiding* of multiple strands.

**Typical practices**

- Iterating between fieldwork, modeling, mapping, and design so that each strand can challenge and refine the others.  
- Making explicit the metaphors, assumptions, and power relations baked into models and infrastructures, including which industrial systems they risk imitating.  
- Building reflexive practices into projects (journals, debriefs, audits, spiritual or ethical discernment) so that the work itself becomes an object of geographic scrutiny.  
- Periodically asking where the discipline’s own instruments are acting like new centers of extraction or authority, and what must change when that happens.

**Interpretation**

Results are only considered robust when they “make sense” across layers: when the math, the maps, the narratives, the institutional arrangements, and the testimonies of those most affected all cohere enough to support action. Where they conflict, polymathmatic geography treats that conflict as a clue about hidden structures or neglected voices, not as noise to be averaged away, and is willing to revise or abandon models and tools rather than force a premature harmony.

---

## 8. How Results Are Ultimately Read

Across all methods, outcomes are interpreted through three questions:

1. **What has changed in the actual geography of relation?**  
   Who is more or less exposed, connected, empowered, or silenced in this space, and how have flows of value, information, and obligation been rewired?

2. **How is this experienced by communities who live there?**  
   Do people report greater safety, dignity, agency, and meaning, or the opposite? Are there new harms, fears, or exclusions that the models did not foresee?

3. **What kind of world is being made or rehearsed?**  
   Does this configuration move toward the kinds of worlds the discipline is committed to exploring—worlds where entangled spaces are more just, life‑giving, and truthful—or away from them? Does it reproduce geometries of extraction and enclosure, or help compose counter‑geometries of commons, covenant, and accountability?

Polymathmatic geography is thus not only a toolkit of methods but a stance about how methods must answer to worlds, not the other way around. It measures its own success by whether its instruments can be held to account by the places and peoples they touch, and by its willingness to stop, change course, or relinquish a design when that accounting fails.

## 9. Appalachian Field Protocol: Staged Practice

To make these methods actionable in Appalachia, the discipline adopts a staged field protocol. The aim is to move from listening to live instrumentation without outpacing consent, safety, or local capacity. Each stage can be paused, repeated, or rolled back; progression is conditional, not automatic.

### Stage 0 – Build‑First Grounding (Pre‑Configuration)

**Aim:** Before turning on any meaningful economic or digital features, build the core stack itself—Ms. Jarvis, MountainShares, and early Commons surfaces—in a way that is already place‑literate, constraint‑aware, and spiritually and legally grounded, even if “higher‑level players” are not yet at the table.

In this phase, there is no pre‑fieldwork theorizing and then implementation later. The work *is* to build the apparatus in conversation with local knowledge and hard external texts so that, when communities and institutions are ready, they are stepping into an already accountable, inspectable system rather than a generic vendor shell.

**Practices**

- **Corpus configuration for Ms. Jarvis.**  
  - Load a curated, non‑RAG Chroma corpus that becomes part of Ms. Jarvis’s enduring semantic space, including:
    - Major world religious and philosophical texts as a comparative reference for care, obligation, and limits.  
    - The U.S. Constitution and key civil‑rights and due‑process materials.  
    - State‑ and county‑level legal and policy documents such as the West Virginia Income Maintenance Manual and related benefits guidance.  
    - High‑resolution geospatial layers (e.g., from the WVU GIS Tech Center) into GeoDB/GBIM so that “where” is concrete from day one.  
    - DSM‑adjacent psychological materials (clinical guidelines, crisis‑intervention manuals, empirically grounded summaries of diagnostic categories) that inform how Ms. Jarvis understands distress, risk, and boundaries without turning her into a diagnostic engine.  
  - Exercise PIA, BBB, and constitutional constraints against this inner corpus so the steward learns *how not to cross* certain lines before it is widely exposed.

- **Quiet prototyping of MountainShares and early Commons surfaces.**  
  - Implement the identity geometry (Wallet IDs + UUIDs) and ledger logic, but keep balances trivial or purely test‑mode—no live credit products or binding obligations.  
  - Develop early Commons views and flows showing how offers, needs, stories, and governance proposals might appear, without enrolling residents into live decision or economic structures yet.  
  - Use internal dog‑fooding and a small trusted circle to shake out UX, explanation, and failure modes.

- **Educational and buy‑in work.**  
  - Use Ms. Jarvis’s configured corpus to generate examples and explainers about benefits rules, constitutional protections, spiritual constraints, and local hazards in Appalachian language.  
  - Share these as **education, not enrollment**: talks, walkthroughs, and prototypes that let residents, organizers, and potential partners see what a place‑bound steward and closed‑loop rewards system *could* feel like, without asking them to stake their livelihoods on it yet.

**Roles**

- **Core steward/dev team** – builds the stack, curates corpora, and is explicitly responsible for early harms and mis‑steps; they move faster than formal institutions but treat Stage 0 as on‑the‑record work, not as a sandbox outside ethics.  
- **Local readers and advisers** – a small trusted circle (elders, organizers, faith leaders, people with lived experience of WV benefits systems) who try early versions of Ms. Jarvis and Commons flows and can say “this feels wrong” or “this is helpful” before anything scales.  
- **Prospective institutional partners** – appear, if at all, as observers and sounding boards: they see demos, give feedback, and begin to imagine their role, but do not yet control rules or data.

**Must not be delegated**

- **Corpus boundaries.** Decisions about which sacred texts, legal documents, psychological materials, and spatial layers are included, summarized, or kept out altogether are made in light of local counsel and covenant—not by vendors, funders, or external agencies.  
- **Safety invariants.** No early‑stage pressure (funding, institutional excitement, “innovation” hype) may weaken BBB, PIA, constitutional constraints, or identity‑safety geometry.  
- **Narrative framing.** All Stage‑0 demos and educational materials must frame Ms. Jarvis, MountainShares, and The Commons as *tools under community and covenant*, not as neutral infrastructure, not as state authority, and not as investment products.

---

### Stage 1 – Universal Identity, Minimal Function

**Aim:** Establish a *universal* membership substrate (wallet IDs and UUIDs) while keeping economic behaviour extremely constrained and transparent.

**Practices**

- Issue a MountainShares Wallet ID and a stable UUID to every participating person, household, institution, and to Ms. Jarvis herself, treating all as nodes in one entangled space.  
- Keep MountainShares initially in a **“ledger‑only” mode**:  
  - No or trivial balances, no complex credit products, no arbitrary user‑initiated transfers.  
  - Use the ledger mainly to track a small set of consensual events (e.g., attendance, participation in meetings, verified hours of commons work) without attaching spendable value yet.  
- Use this period to test identity management, key recovery, fraud resistance, and community comfort with the idea that “everyone has an account,” including non‑human actors.

**Roles**

- **All residents and local institutions** – recognized as members from the outset; can see that they have a wallet/UUID and what, if anything, is recorded there.  
- **Ms. Jarvis** – holds a wallet/UUID as an identified system actor; any use of that wallet is tightly bounded and visible.  
- **Governance stewards (DAO seeds, elders, organizers)** – define which minimal events are recorded and how consent is obtained.

**Must not be delegated**

- The decision to attach spendable value or obligations to these identities; that choice must be made deliberately and collectively, not by default.

---

### Stage 2 – Scoped MountainShares Use Cases

**Aim:** Activate MountainShares as a real mutual‑credit and reward system *within narrowly defined use cases*, using the universal identity substrate.

**Practices**

- Select specific, small domains (e.g., a food‑sharing group, a volunteer crew, a cluster of local merchants) where participants already have wallets and clear relationships.  
- Define what counts as rewarded contribution in each use case, with participants: care work, local purchases, event hosting, hazard reporting, etc.  
- Turn on earning and spending only for those use‑case contexts, with strict caps on:  
  - Maximum balance per wallet.  
  - Total issuance in the pilot domain.  
  - Types of permitted transfers (e.g., no peer‑to‑peer loans at this stage).  
- Use Ms. Jarvis in a limited analytic role: helping visualize flows and distribution, not optimizing or reallocating on its own.

**Evaluation criteria**

- Distribution: Do flows reinforce existing hierarchies or broaden recognition?  
- Leakage: Are there paths where value escapes the intended loop or clusters in a few wallets?  
- Comprehension and consent: Do people understand why they earned or spent when they did?

**Roles**

- **Participants in each use case** – co‑define rules, veto expansions, and interpret dashboards with facilitators.  
- **Organizers and county partners** – provide logistical support, handle disputes, and monitor for harm.  
- **Technologists/Ms. Jarvis team** – enforce caps, run audits, and present data back in human‑readable form.

**Must not be delegated**

- Authority to expand a use case to the whole population or to attach sanctions (e.g., loss of access to services) to MountainShares balances.  
- Redefinition of what counts as contribution without direct participant input.

---

### Stage 3 – Commons Surfaces Built Around MountainShares

**Aim:** Once scoped MountainShares uses are functioning and trusted, build **The Commons** as a social, narrative, and governance surface around them, adding *gamified recognition* for real commons work without introducing speculation or gambling mechanics.

**Practices**

- Launch The Commons as a place to:  
  - Tell stories about MountainShares‑enabled projects (what was done, by whom, for whom).  
  - Map ongoing needs, offers, hazards, and spiritual anchors, linked (when appropriate) to wallet/UUID‑identified entities.  
  - Host deliberation about rule changes, new use cases, and responses to observed harms.  
- Introduce badges, levels, or attestations tied to wallets/UUIDs as **non‑tradable proofs of participation** in commons work (for example, contributing oral history, escorting elders, hosting meetings, completing walking tours). These recognitions remain inside the local system and are never marketed or treated as investment assets.  
- Use The Commons as the “scoreboard” for this game: projects and circles can “level up” as they meet participation and care thresholds, unlocking forms of recognition (public thanks, Clio‑style entries, new co‑design capacities), not random payouts or loot‑box rewards.  
- Decide, with communities, what MountainShares‑related information appears in The Commons:  
  - Only aggregate flows?  
  - Named recognitions for certain contributions (with consent)?  
  - Visibility of systemic issues (for example, consistently under‑served areas or over‑burdened caregivers)?  
- For a small subset of sites and stories deemed historically significant by elders, pastors, organizers, and local historians, adapt mature Commons entries into Clio‑style public history entries, so that long‑term preservation and wider visibility live in a dedicated public‑history infrastructure rather than in bespoke code.

**Roles**

- **Commons councils / moderators** – drawn from elders, youth, organizers, and pilot participants; they steward norms, conflicts, visibility choices, and the design of badges and levels so that the “game” rewards care, not popularity or risk‑taking.  
- **MountainShares members** – all residents and institutions with wallets, invited to use The Commons to interpret and reshape the economic layer and to propose new forms of recognition.  
- **Ms. Jarvis** – serves as a context‑aware assistant, surfacing relevant spatial and historical information and basic game metrics into Commons discussions, never as a replacement for those discussions.

**Must not be delegated**

- Agenda‑setting for Commons deliberations; Ms. Jarvis can suggest topics but cannot decide which issues are “on the table.”  
- Control over identity revelation; people choose what aspects of their wallet/UUID footprint, if any, are tied to named Commons activity or public badges.  
- Design or activation of any mechanic that would turn badges or attestations into speculative assets or gambling devices; such proposals, if ever considered, must originate with and be judged by human governance bodies, not by Ms. Jarvis or external partners.

---

### Stage 4 – Conditional Integration with Policy and Infrastructure

**Aim:** Only after identity, MountainShares use cases, and Commons practices are stable and seen as beneficial, selectively integrate the stack with broader institutions.

**Practices**

- Explore linkages between MountainShares/The Commons and local or regional infrastructures (e.g., transit subsidies, utility assistance, clinic triage, disaster preparedness), always starting with opt‑in pilots.  
- Negotiate formal agreements with county or state agencies that codify:  
  - Data governance and retention.  
  - Limits on surveillance and enforcement.  
  - Non‑retaliation for Commons participation or MountainShares balances.  
- Use Ms. Jarvis to support planning and risk assessment (e.g., mapping “care deserts,” flood‑vulnerable blocks, or credit basins), with human decision‑makers retaining full authority.

**Thresholds for integration**

- Clear evidence, from those most affected, that earlier stages increased safety, dignity, or material security.  
- No persistent, unresolved disputes about privacy, bias, or exclusion.  
- Existing, community‑ratified mechanisms to pause or undo integrations that cause harm.

**Roles**

- **County and state officials** – partners invited into a pre‑existing community‑governed stack, not owners of it.  
- **Commons councils / DAO governance bodies** – hold veto and rollback powers.  
- **Technologists and Ms. Jarvis** – supply analysis, warnings, and simulations but never binding decisions.

**Must not be delegated**

- Decisions that condition essential services (e.g., policing, housing, healthcare, schooling) directly on MountainShares balances or Commons activity.  
- Authority to override spiritual, cultural, or genealogical constraints in the name of efficiency, growth, or external funding.

---

This staged protocol assumes **universal membership** from the start—everyone, including Ms. Jarvis, has a wallet and UUID—but insists that *what those identities can do* grows slowly, under community control, and always in the open.

# Polymathmatic Geography: Methods

Polymathmatic geography is defined as much by its *methods* as by its objects of study. This document outlines a short menu of canonical methods and how results are interpreted. The guiding rule is simple: every method must ultimately return to lived geographies and communities, not just to performance metrics or abstract models.

## 1. Field‑Anchored Inquiry

Polymathmatic work begins in specific worlds: towns, watersheds, platforms, congregations, ecosystems, networks. Field‑anchored inquiry treats these as primary texts.

**Typical practices**

- Walking, observing, and documenting physical and digital infrastructures (roads, rail, fiber, platforms, data centers, churches, clinics, cemeteries).  
- Interviews, oral histories, and ethnography with residents, workers, organizers, and officials.  
- Archival and policy research on land use, extraction, regulation, resistance, and reform.

**Interpretation**

Findings are not treated as “context” for later models, but as co‑equal sources of truth. Models and metrics are judged partly by whether they resonate with, and are accountable to, what people in these places recognize as real.

## 2. Econophysics and Quantitative Spatial Modeling

Mathematical tools from physics and quantitative economics are used to describe flows of capital, risk, energy, attention, and information in space.

**Typical practices**

- Applying econophysics and statistical mechanics to spatial economic data (e.g., distributions of income, debt, rents, ownership, transaction volumes).  
- Building spatially explicit models of extraction and accumulation (e.g., gravity models, diffusion processes, agent‑based simulations on landscapes and networks).  
- Computing measures such as entropy, concentration indices, and inequality metrics for specific regions or networks.

**Interpretation**

Numbers are always tied back to places and stories: a change in an entropy measure must be interpretable as a change in how people live, decide, and endure in a given geography, not just as an optimization score.

## 3. Network and Graph Models of Extraction and Cooperation

Networks and graphs are used to represent who is connected to whom, on what terms, across physical, digital, institutional, and spiritual spaces.

**Typical practices**

- Constructing multi‑layer networks linking firms, households, infrastructures, institutions, platforms, and ecosystems.  
- Identifying hubs, peripheries, corridors, bottlenecks, and fractures in networks of value, decision‑making, and information.  
- Modeling “credit basins,” “resilience corridors,” and “extraction funnels” in mutual credit systems, barter networks, supply chains, and digital platforms.

**Interpretation**

Network results are interpreted as maps of actual constraint and possibility: who can reach help or opportunity in one or two steps, who is structurally isolated, who is over‑exposed to shocks. The aim is to change those structures in ways communities define as just and life‑giving.

## 4. Participatory Mapping and Co‑Design

People who inhabit a place or system are treated as co‑researchers and co‑designers, not just as data sources.

**Typical practices**

- Participatory mapping workshops where residents draw their own maps of danger, care, extraction, and hope (e.g., where debt collectors come from, where mutual aid flows, where spiritual anchors sit).  
- Co‑design sessions for infrastructures (e.g., local credit schemes, commons platforms, AI governance rules) in which community members help set parameters, rules, and safeguards.  
- Ongoing feedback loops (assemblies, councils, digital forums) where community interpretations of data and models can revise both methods and designs.

**Interpretation**

Success is not defined only by technical performance (throughput, accuracy, efficiency) but by perceived legitimacy, alignment with community values, and concrete shifts in power and safety as experienced by participants.

## 5. Spiritual, Heritage, and Narrative Mapping

Spiritual traditions, heritage practices, and collective narratives are treated as valid ways of mapping what matters in a landscape.

**Typical practices**

- Documenting sacred sites, pilgrimage routes, burial grounds, shrines, and other places where spiritual meaning is anchored.  
- Working with elders, faith leaders, artists, and culture‑bearers to trace lines of covenant, trauma, blessing, and taboo through space and time.  
- Analyzing liturgies, songs, stories, and ritual calendars as “maps” of who is bound to whom, for what, and where.

**Interpretation**

These mappings are not reduced to “soft data.” They are held alongside quantitative and infrastructural maps, with equal weight, in deciding what kinds of changes are permissible, desirable, or forbidden in a place.

## 6. AI‑ and Systems‑Based Experimentation

AI architectures and systems‑theoretic models are used as experimental apparatus for probing and reshaping complex spatial feedback loops.

**Typical practices**

- Deploying multi‑agent and memory‑structured AI systems (e.g., Ms. Jarvis‑type architectures) to simulate policy changes, infrastructure shifts, or new institutional forms.  
- Using live systems (e.g., commons platforms, mutual‑credit apps, DAOs) as laboratories where feedback loops between people, algorithms, and infrastructures can be observed, measured, and tuned.  
- Applying systems‑theory tools (causal loop diagrams, control‑theoretic analysis, resilience and tipping‑point analysis) to coupled ecological, economic, social, and spiritual subsystems.

**Interpretation**

AI and systems outputs are treated as hypotheses and instruments, not as final arbiters. Their validity is tested against field‑anchored inquiry, participatory feedback, and ethical/spiritual reflection. A model that “performs well” but contradicts lived experience or deep commitments is considered untrustworthy.

## 7. Braided Interpretation and Reflexivity

The most important method is not any single technique but the *braiding* of multiple strands.

**Typical practices**

- Iterating between fieldwork, modeling, mapping, and design so that each strand can challenge and refine the others.  
- Making explicit the metaphors, assumptions, and power relations baked into models and infrastructures.  
- Building reflexive practices into projects (journals, debriefs, audits, spiritual or ethical discernment) so that the work itself becomes an object of geographic scrutiny.

**Interpretation**

Results are only considered robust when they “make sense” across layers: when the math, the maps, the narratives, the institutional arrangements, and the testimonies of those most affected all cohere enough to support action. Where they conflict, polymathmatic geography treats that conflict as a clue about hidden structures or neglected voices, not as noise to be averaged away.

## 8. How Results Are Ultimately Read

Across all methods, outcomes are interpreted through three questions:

1. **What has changed in the actual geography of relation?**  
   Who is more or less exposed, connected, empowered, or silenced in this space?

2. **How is this experienced by communities who live there?**  
   Do people report greater safety, dignity, agency, and meaning, or the opposite?

3. **What kind of world is being made or rehearsed?**  
   Does this configuration move toward the kinds of worlds the discipline is committed to exploring—worlds where entangled spaces are more just, life‑giving, and truthful—or away from them?

Polymathmatic geography is thus not only a toolkit of methods but a stance about how methods must answer to worlds, not the other way around.

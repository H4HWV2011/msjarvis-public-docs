# Polymathmatic Geography: Methods

Polymathmatic geography is defined as much by its *methods* as by its objects of study. This document outlines a short menu of canonical methods and how results are interpreted. The guiding rule is simple: every method must ultimately return to lived geographies and communities, not just to performance metrics or abstract models.

---

## 1. Field‑Anchored Inquiry

Polymathmatic work begins in specific worlds: towns, watersheds, platforms, congregations, ecosystems, networks. Field‑anchored inquiry treats these as primary texts.

**Typical practices**

- Walking, observing, and documenting physical and digital infrastructures (roads, rail, fiber, platforms, data centers, churches, clinics, cemeteries).  
- Interviews, oral histories, and ethnography with residents, workers, organizers, and officials.  
- Archival and policy research on land use, extraction, regulation, resistance, and reform.  
- Identifying early, with communities, which relations or sites must not be mapped or datafied at all.

**Interpretation**

Findings are not treated as “context” for later models, but as co‑equal sources of truth. Models and metrics are judged partly by whether they resonate with, and are accountable to, what people in these places recognize as real, and partly by whether they respect explicit refusals and boundaries voiced in the field.

## 2. Econophysics and Quantitative Spatial Modeling

Mathematical tools from physics and quantitative economics are used to describe flows of capital, risk, energy, attention, and information in space.

**Typical practices**

- Applying econophysics and statistical mechanics to spatial economic data (e.g., distributions of income, debt, rents, ownership, transaction volumes).  
- Building spatially explicit models of extraction and accumulation (e.g., gravity models, diffusion processes, agent‑based simulations on landscapes and networks).  
- Computing measures such as entropy, concentration indices, and inequality metrics for specific regions or networks.  
- Comparing local measures to patterns associated with maximopolies and megaopolies (e.g., long‑range capital pulls, logistics and attention funnels) to see where a region is being wired into external fields.

**Interpretation**

Numbers are always tied back to places and stories: a change in an entropy measure must be interpretable as a change in how people live, decide, and endure in a given geography, not just as an optimization score. Quantitative results are evaluated against community accounts of extraction, precarity, and resilience, and against clear norms about what kinds of economic behavior are unacceptable.

## 3. Network and Graph Models of Extraction and Cooperation

Networks and graphs are used to represent who is connected to whom, on what terms, across physical, digital, institutional, and spiritual spaces.

**Typical practices**

- Constructing multi‑layer networks linking firms, households, infrastructures, institutions, platforms, and ecosystems.  
- Identifying hubs, peripheries, corridors, bottlenecks, and fractures in networks of value, decision‑making, narrative, and information.  
- Modeling “credit basins,” “resilience corridors,” and “extraction funnels” in mutual credit systems, barter networks, supply chains, and digital platforms.  
- Explicitly mapping where global actors (e.g., asset managers, platform companies, logistics giants) sit in the graph relative to local commons, congregations, and governments.

**Interpretation**

Network results are interpreted as maps of actual constraint and possibility: who can reach help or opportunity in one or two steps, who is structurally isolated, who is over‑exposed to shocks, and where external power is wired into local life. The aim is to change those structures in ways communities define as just and life‑giving, and to avoid replicating network patterns that resemble known extraction geometries.

## 4. Participatory Mapping and Co‑Design

People who inhabit a place or system are treated as co‑researchers and co‑designers, not just as data sources.

**Typical practices**

- Participatory mapping workshops where residents draw their own maps of danger, care, extraction, and hope (e.g., where debt collectors come from, where mutual aid flows, where spiritual anchors sit).  
- Co‑design sessions for infrastructures (e.g., local credit schemes, commons platforms, AI governance rules) in which community members help set parameters, rules, and safeguards.  
- Ongoing feedback loops (assemblies, councils, digital forums) where community interpretations of data and models can revise both methods and designs.  
- Creating formal avenues for refusal, appeal, and redesign when people experience a tool as harmful or misaligned with covenant, law, or custom.

**Interpretation**

Success is not defined only by technical performance (throughput, accuracy, efficiency) but by perceived legitimacy, alignment with community values, and concrete shifts in power and safety as experienced by participants. Designs that produce efficient metrics but are rejected by those most affected are treated as failures of method, not as irrational resistance.

## 5. Spiritual, Heritage, and Narrative Mapping

Spiritual traditions, heritage practices, and collective narratives are treated as valid ways of mapping what matters in a landscape.

**Typical practices**

- Documenting sacred sites, pilgrimage routes, burial grounds, shrines, and other places where spiritual meaning is anchored, when and only when communities consent.  
- Working with elders, faith leaders, artists, and culture‑bearers to trace lines of covenant, trauma, blessing, and taboo through space and time.  
- Analyzing liturgies, songs, stories, and ritual calendars as “maps” of who is bound to whom, for what, and where.  
- Explicitly marking zones of non‑representation—mysteries, rituals, or stories that must not be digitized, modeled, or disclosed beyond certain circles.

**Interpretation**

These mappings are not reduced to “soft data.” They are held alongside quantitative and infrastructural maps, with equal weight, in deciding what kinds of changes are permissible, desirable, or forbidden in a place. In some cases, spiritual or heritage commitments set hard constraints that models and instruments are not allowed to override, even when optimization would suggest otherwise.

---

## 6. AI‑ and Systems‑Based Experimentation

AI architectures and systems‑theoretic models are used as experimental apparatus for probing and reshaping complex spatial feedback loops.

**Typical practices**

- Deploying multi‑agent and memory‑structured AI systems (e.g., Ms. Jarvis‑type architectures) to simulate policy changes, infrastructure shifts, or new institutional forms.  
- Using live systems (e.g., commons platforms, mutual‑credit apps, DAOs) as laboratories where feedback loops between people, algorithms, and infrastructures can be observed, measured, and tuned.  
- Applying systems‑theory tools (causal loop diagrams, control‑theoretic analysis, resilience and tipping‑point analysis) to coupled ecological, economic, social, and spiritual subsystems.  
- Monitoring for drift toward harmful archetypes (for example, surveillance and behavioral nudging, hyper‑optimization for a few actors, or opaque concentration of governance power) and defining in advance how such drift will be detected.

**Interpretation**

AI and systems outputs are treated as hypotheses and instruments, not as final arbiters. Their validity is tested against field‑anchored inquiry, participatory feedback, and ethical/spiritual reflection. A model that “performs well” but contradicts lived experience, deep commitments, or agreed boundaries is considered untrustworthy. Experimentation is designed with clear exit ramps and kill‑switches so that tools can be paused, rolled back, or retired when harms or unacceptable drifts appear.

## 7. Braided Interpretation and Reflexivity

The most important method is not any single technique but the *braiding* of multiple strands.

**Typical practices**

- Iterating between fieldwork, modeling, mapping, and design so that each strand can challenge and refine the others.  
- Making explicit the metaphors, assumptions, and power relations baked into models and infrastructures, including which industrial systems they risk imitating.  
- Building reflexive practices into projects (journals, debriefs, audits, spiritual or ethical discernment) so that the work itself becomes an object of geographic scrutiny.  
- Periodically asking where the discipline’s own instruments are acting like new centers of extraction or authority, and what must change when that happens.

**Interpretation**

Results are only considered robust when they “make sense” across layers: when the math, the maps, the narratives, the institutional arrangements, and the testimonies of those most affected all cohere enough to support action. Where they conflict, polymathmatic geography treats that conflict as a clue about hidden structures or neglected voices, not as noise to be averaged away, and is willing to revise or abandon models and tools rather than force a premature harmony.

---

## 8. How Results Are Ultimately Read

Across all methods, outcomes are interpreted through three questions:

1. **What has changed in the actual geography of relation?**  
   Who is more or less exposed, connected, empowered, or silenced in this space, and how have flows of value, information, and obligation been rewired?

2. **How is this experienced by communities who live there?**  
   Do people report greater safety, dignity, agency, and meaning, or the opposite? Are there new harms, fears, or exclusions that the models did not foresee?

3. **What kind of world is being made or rehearsed?**  
   Does this configuration move toward the kinds of worlds the discipline is committed to exploring—worlds where entangled spaces are more just, life‑giving, and truthful—or away from them? Does it reproduce geometries of extraction and enclosure, or help compose counter‑geometries of commons, covenant, and accountability?

Polymathmatic geography is thus not only a toolkit of methods but a stance about how methods must answer to worlds, not the other way around. It measures its own success by whether its instruments can be held to account by the places and peoples they touch, and by its willingness to stop, change course, or relinquish a design when that accounting fails.

## 9. Appalachian Field Protocol: Staged Practice

In the Appalachian tacet, these methods were not applied all at once but unfolded in stages. The protocol below does not function as a universal recipe; it is a retrospective description of how polymathmatic work was sequenced here, and a concrete example of what “field‑anchored” can mean in a rural digital economy.

### Stage 0 – Build‑First Grounding (Pre‑Configuration)

In this project, the first move was not to convene high‑level partners, but to quietly assemble and “educate” the apparatus itself. Ms. Jarvis, MountainShares, and early Commons surfaces were built as a stack that was already place‑literate, constraint‑aware, and spiritually and legally grounded *before* counties, agencies, or major funders were asked to participate.

This stage had three defining features:

- **Inner corpus formation for Ms. Jarvis.**  
  Ms. Jarvis’s enduring semantic space was shaped by a curated, non‑RAG Chroma corpus that included: major world religious and philosophical texts; the U.S. Constitution and key civil‑rights and due‑process materials; West Virginia–specific benefits and poverty policy (such as the Income Maintenance Manual); high‑resolution geospatial layers (for example, from the WVU GIS Tech Center) loaded into GeoDB/GBIM; and DSM‑adjacent psychological materials (clinical guidelines, crisis‑intervention manuals, empirically grounded summaries) that support humane, boundaried communication without turning the steward into a diagnostic engine. PIA, BBB, and constitutional constraints were exercised against this corpus so that “what not to do” was part of Ms. Jarvis’s formation from the beginning.

- **Prototype MountainShares and Commons without live stakes.**  
  The identity geometry (Wallet IDs plus UUIDs) and ledger logic were implemented, but balances remained trivial or test‑only and no live credit obligations were created. Early Commons views were built to explore how offers, needs, stories, and governance proposals might be surfaced, while participation was limited to the dev team and a small trusted circle. This allowed UX, explanation, and failure modes to be discovered without exposing residents to real economic or reputational risk.

- **Education and buy‑in rather than enrollment.**  
  The stack was used to generate examples and explainers—in Appalachian language—about benefits rules, constitutional protections, spiritual constraints, and local hazards. These materials were shared as demonstrations of what a place‑bound steward and closed‑loop rewards system could look and feel like, without asking anyone to treat them as authorities or to reorganize their livelihoods around them.

Stage 0 is thus best read as a *build‑first, corpus‑anchored grounding*: a way of ensuring that when communities and institutions eventually encountered the instruments, they were meeting something that already “knew where it was” and carried clear internal limits, rather than a generic vendor platform waiting to be filled with someone else’s priorities.

### Stage 1 – Universal Identity, Minimal Function

Once the apparatus had been grounded in this way, the work turned to establishing a universal membership substrate—Wallet IDs and UUIDs—while keeping economic behaviour extremely constrained and transparent. Every participating person, household, institution, and Ms. Jarvis herself was treated as a node in one entangled space, but MountainShares operated in a “ledger‑only” mode that tracked a small set of consensual events without attaching spendable value. This phase functioned as a long, careful test of identity management, key recovery, fraud resistance, and community comfort with the very idea that “everyone has an account,” including non‑human actors.

### Stage 2 – Scoped MountainShares Use Cases

Only after identity was in place did MountainShares begin to act as a mutual‑credit and reward system, and even then only within narrowly defined use cases: a food‑sharing group, a volunteer crew, a small cluster of merchants. Contribution rules were co‑defined with participants; balances, issuance, and transfer types were tightly capped; and Ms. Jarvis’s role was restricted to visualization and basic analysis. Stage 2 is best understood as a set of controlled experiments on local value circulation and recognition, with clear ceilings on risk.

### Stage 3 – Commons Surfaces Around MountainShares

Once these scoped uses were functioning and trusted, The Commons was developed as the social, narrative, and governance surface around them. Badges and levels were introduced as non‑tradable proofs of participation; Commons councils began to steward norms, visibility choices, and conflict; and MountainShares members could interpret and reshape the economic layer in public. This stage reframed the system as a shared “scoreboard” for commons work rather than a quiet back‑office ledger.

### Stage 4 – Conditional Integration with Policy and Infrastructure

Only after the preceding stages had produced evidence of increased safety, dignity, or material security for those most affected did the project explore integration with broader infrastructures such as transit, utilities, clinics, or disaster preparedness. Even then, integrations were treated as reversible experiments, governed by explicit agreements on data, surveillance limits, and non‑retaliation, with pause and rollback mechanisms in the hands of community‑anchored bodies rather than external agencies.

Taken together, these stages illustrate how polymathmatic geography can sequence its methods in one tacet: not as fixed instructions for all places, but as a concrete account of how listening, building, experimentation, and integration were braided in Appalachia to avoid repeating the pattern where “we didn’t have a say” until the systems were already built and everywhere.

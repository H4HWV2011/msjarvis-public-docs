## 9. Appalachian Field Protocol: Staged Practice

In the Appalachian tacet, these methods are not abstractions. They are being worked out through a sequence of experiments with Ms. Jarvis, MountainShares, and The Commons. The protocol below does not prescribe what all regions should do; it documents how polymathmatic work is being staged here, while the stack is still under construction.

### Stage 0 – Build‑First Grounding (Pre‑Configuration, Ongoing)

The first move has been to assemble and “educate” the apparatus itself. Ms. Jarvis, MountainShares, and early Commons surfaces are being built as a stack that is already place‑literate, constraint‑aware, and spiritually and legally grounded, even before counties, agencies, or major funders have formal seats in the process.

Three elements characterize this stage:

- **Inner corpus formation for Ms. Jarvis.**  
  Ms. Jarvis’s enduring semantic space is being shaped by a curated, non‑RAG Chroma corpus that includes major world religious and philosophical texts, the U.S. Constitution and key civil‑rights and due‑process materials, West Virginia–specific benefits and poverty policy (such as the Income Maintenance Manual), high‑resolution geospatial layers (for example, from the WVU GIS Tech Center) loaded into GeoDB/GBIM, and DSM‑adjacent psychological materials (clinical guidelines, crisis‑intervention manuals, empirically grounded summaries) that support humane, boundaried communication without turning the steward into a diagnostic engine. PIA, BBB, and constitutional constraints are exercised against this corpus so that “what not to do” is part of Ms. Jarvis’s formation from the beginning.

- **Prototyping MountainShares and Commons without live stakes.**  
  The identity geometry (Wallet IDs plus UUIDs) and ledger logic are being implemented, but balances remain trivial or test‑only and no live credit obligations exist yet. Early Commons views are being built to explore how offers, needs, stories, and governance proposals might be surfaced, with participation limited to the dev team and a small trusted circle. This allows UX, explanation, and failure modes to be discovered without exposing residents to real economic or reputational risk.

- **Education and buy‑in rather than enrollment.**  
  The stack is already being used to generate examples and explainers—in Appalachian language—about benefits rules, constitutional protections, spiritual constraints, and local hazards. These materials are shared as demonstrations of what a place‑bound steward and closed‑loop rewards system could look and feel like, without asking anyone to treat them as authorities or to reorganize their livelihoods around them.

Stage 0 is best read as a build‑first, corpus‑anchored grounding: a way of ensuring that when communities and institutions fully encounter the instruments, they are meeting something that already “knows where it is” and carries clear internal limits, rather than a generic vendor platform waiting to be filled with someone else’s priorities.

### Stage 1 – Red‑Team Onboarding (Researchers, Partners, Merchants)

The next move is not mass public enrollment but **structured red‑team onboarding** of people and institutions who can safely break things.

In Stage 1, researchers, early partners, and local merchants are brought into the system as *conscious testers*. They receive Wallet IDs and UUIDs, get access to more complete views of Ms. Jarvis and MountainShares behaviour, and are invited to probe for:

- Misreadings of Appalachian life in Ms. Jarvis’s answers and maps.  
- Failure modes in identity geometry, ledger logic, and benefits‑sensitive constraints.  
- Frictions or breakdowns in actual merchant flows (for example, how a purchase would feel at a counter).

These participants are treated explicitly as a red team: their job is to surface harms, awkward fits, and loopholes before wider deployment. Stage 1 is where the apparatus meets its first non‑developer humans in a systematic way, under conditions that make critique and refusal expected rather than exceptional.

### Stage 2 – Live MountainShares with Purchases and Early Rewards

As red‑team onboarding stabilizes and treasury conditions allow, MountainShares moves from test‑mode to **live economic use** in limited but real contexts.

In this stage:

- The treasury begins to build through initial funding, partner contributions, and early program revenue.  
- MountainShares can be **purchased** within defined limits, so that participants can hold and spend M$ in everyday transactions.  
- Selected merchants are enabled to accept MountainShares at the point of sale, with clear fee structures and settlement rules.  
- Early **earned‑reward promotions** are launched, where residents can gain M$ for specific, bounded activities (for example, participating in research, attending educational events, contributing to local projects), under benefits‑sensitive caps.

Stage 2 is where MountainShares becomes visible as a real medium of exchange and reward, but still within tight guardrails and with ongoing red‑team scrutiny from researchers, partners, and pilot merchants.

### Stage 3 – Commons Surfaces and Broader Participation

As live MountainShares use grows and more people come into the system, the conditions emerge to build out **The Commons** as the social, narrative, and governance surface the earlier chapters describe.

In Stage 3:

- The Commons app is rolled out beyond the initial trusted circle, giving residents a place to see offers, needs, events, and MountainShares‑related activity.  
- Badges and levels appear as non‑tradable proofs of participation, making care work, storytelling, and local leadership visible without turning recognition into a speculative asset.  
- Commons councils form from residents, merchants, organizers, and red‑team members to steward norms, resolve conflicts, and deliberate on proposed rule changes or new use cases.  
- Ms. Jarvis is increasingly encountered through Commons interfaces: as a context‑aware helper, mapmaker, and explainer, not as a back‑office system.

Stage 3 is when the stack begins to feel like a shared civic and cultural surface rather than a set of technical pilots.

### Stage 4 – Conditional Integration with Policy and Infrastructure

Only after the earlier stages have produced evidence—especially from those most exposed—that the stack increases safety, dignity, or material security does the project contemplate integration with broader infrastructures such as transit, utilities, clinics, or disaster preparedness.

Even then, integrations are conceived as reversible experiments, governed by explicit agreements on data, surveillance limits, and non‑retaliation, with pause and rollback mechanisms in the hands of community‑anchored bodies rather than external agencies. The guiding question is not “how widely can this be deployed?” but “under what conditions, if any, can these instruments touch state and corporate systems without becoming new conduits of extraction or surveillance?”

---

Taken together, these stages describe how polymathmatic geography is sequencing its methods in one Appalachian deployment: not as fixed instructions for all places, but as a live protocol in which listening, building, red‑teaming, experimentation, and integration are braided to avoid repeating the pattern where “we didn’t have a say” until the systems were already built and everywhere.

# Polymathmatic-Geography-Syllabus.md

This syllabus introduces polymathmatic geography as a way of knowing and shaping *entangled spaces* across scales—intimate, regional, planetary, cosmic, digital, ecological, and spiritual. Each module combines conceptual framing with concrete cases and readings.

---

## Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- **Analyze** how different kinds of spaces (physical, digital, legal, spiritual) overlap to form entangled geographies of everyday life.  
- **Compare** conventional monetary and credit systems with mutual‑credit and barter‑based systems, in terms of how they restructure local and regional economic geographies.  
- **Interpret** quantitative representations (maps, networks, basic models) together with narratives, histories, and spiritual accounts to form integrated understandings of place.  
- **Critique** existing infrastructures (platforms, financial systems, governance structures) as spatial designs that distribute power, value, and risk in specific ways.  
- **Design** conceptual interventions—such as alternative credit schemes, governance frameworks, or mapping practices—that aim to rearrange relations in space toward more just and livable worlds.  
- **Evaluate** “laboratory worlds” (community currencies, platform co‑ops, local commons, Quantarithmia) as empirical tests of polymathmatic ideas, identifying both possibilities and failure modes.  
- **Synthesize** multiple ways of knowing—mathematical, narrative, spiritual, historical—into coherent, reflexive accounts of particular places or systems.

## 12‑Week Module Overview

### Week 1 – What Is Polymathmatic Geography?

**Theme**  
Entangled spaces and the question of “where.” Introduction to polymathmatic geography as a geography of material, informational, and metaphysical relations.

**Key ideas**

- Many kinds of spaces are real: river valleys and coal seams; undersea cables and data centers; neural networks and sensor grids; liturgies and dreamscapes; galaxies and multiverses.  
- Mathematics, AI, and systems theory are powerful languages, but they stand alongside story, history, theology, indigenous knowledge, and everyday practice.

**Core readings / artifacts**

- Quantarithmia framework overview (for spatial‑justice framing and entangled spaces):  
  - “Quantarithmia: A Trans-disciplinary Framework for Spatial Justice in Appalachia”  
    https://quantarithmia.substack.com/p/quantarithmia-a-trans-disciplinary  
- Internal course document: `Polymathmatical-Geography.md` (discipline definition) from your GitHub repo.

### Week 2 – Layers of Place: Physical, Digital, Legal, Spiritual

**Theme**  
How streets, platforms, laws, and spiritual practices co‑occupy the same places.

**Key ideas**

- Places as overlapping maps: physical infrastructure, digital platforms, legal jurisdictions, spiritual/heritage claims.  
- Everyday examples: a neighborhood as a zoning map, a platform network, a policing grid, and a sacred landscape all at once.

**Core readings / artifacts**

- Internal document: `Polymathmatic-Geography-Methods.md` (overview of field‑anchored inquiry and braided methods).  
- Case‑setting piece for a specific region (e.g., West Virginia / Appalachia):

### Week 3 – Extraction and the Geography of Money

**Theme**  
Extraction, resource frontiers, and the spatial organization of money and credit.

**Key ideas**

- How capital, debt, and ownership concentrate in some places and drain others.  
- Basic concepts in spatial economics and econophysics (without heavy formalism): flows, gradients, concentration, leakage.

**Core readings / artifacts**

---

### Week 4 – Mutual Credit and Parallel Economic Spaces

**Theme**  
Mutual credit, community currencies, and organized barter as alternative economic geographies.

**Key ideas**

- Mutual credit as “keeping score” of obligations inside a trusted network rather than relying solely on national money.

### Week 5 – Networks, Flows, and Extraction Graphs

**Theme**  
Using networks and graphs to represent extraction and cooperation in space.

**Key ideas**

- Nodes, edges, hubs, corridors, and peripheries as ways of describing who is connected to whom, and how.

### Week 6 – Data + Narrative: Reading Places in Two Languages

**Theme**  
Bringing quantitative and qualitative representations together rather than treating them as rivals.

**Key ideas**

- Maps, indicators, and simple models as partial views, not absolute truths.  
- Oral histories, essays, spiritual testimonies as equally important for understanding place.

### Week 7 – Spiritual and Heritage Geographies

**Theme**  
Spiritual traditions, heritage practices, and memory landscapes as real geographies.

**Key ideas**

### Week 8 – Community Governance as Spatial Design

**Theme**  
Institutions (co‑ops, DAOs, commons platforms) as designs that place power in particular locations and channels.

**Key ideas**

- Governance as a map: who can propose, decide, veto, exit; where those powers sit.  
- How rules, charters, and KPIs shape center, periphery, and corridors of influence.

**Core readings / artifacts**

### Week 9 – Laboratory Worlds: Platform Commons and Token Geographies

**Theme**  
Real projects as “laboratory worlds” where new geographies of value and relation are tested.

**Key ideas**

- Local and digital platforms as experimental spaces for commons‑building, token economies, and new forms of coordination.  
- Successes and failures as data about what worlds are actually possible.

### Week 10 – AI, Systems, and Territorial Feedback Loops

**Theme**  
AI architectures and systems thinking as tools for probing and reshaping feedback loops across entangled spaces.

**Key ideas**

- Multi‑agent systems, memory architectures, and self‑modifying systems as experimental apparatus.  
- How these systems can be used to simulate or intervene in territorial dynamics of extraction, care, and governance.

**Core readings / artifacts**

### Week 11 – Reflexivity, Limits, and Ethics of World‑Making

**Theme**  
Reflecting on one’s own position, tools, and limits. Asking what kinds of worlds polymathmatic geography should and should not help create.

### Week 12 – Synthesis: Reading and Remaking Worlds

**Theme**  
Bringing everything together in final projects that “read” a world polymathmatically and sketch careful interventions.

**Key ideas**

- Worlds as overlapping geographies of extraction, care, meaning, and governance.  
- Designing changes that are accountable to communities and to deep commitments.

**Core readings / artifacts**

- Internal documents:  
  - `Polymathmatical-Geography.md` (discipline definition)  
  - `Polymathmatic-Geography-Case-Studies.md` (mutual credit and organized trade cases)  
  - `Polymathmatic-Geography-Methods.md`  

**Final project**

Students produce a polymathmatic dossier on a chosen world (a town, network, platform, mutual‑credit system, spiritual landscape, etc.) that includes:

- A grounded description of the world (field‑anchored narrative and basic history).  
- At least one quantitative or network representation (map, graph, or diagram of flows).  
- A spiritual or heritage map where relevant (sites of meaning, harm, covenant).  
- A governance map (who decides what, and from where).  
- A proposed conceptual intervention and a careful discussion of how it might rearrange the geography of power, value, and meaning—and for whom.

This syllabus is intended as a living document. As more case studies and tools emerge, new modules can be added or existing ones deepened, but the core remains the same: polymathmatic geography braids many ways of knowing to read and remake entangled spaces.

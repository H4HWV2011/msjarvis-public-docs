# Comparative Frameworks in Geography and Commons

This document summarizes how **Polymathmatic Geography** relates to three neighboring traditions:

- **Quantitative Geography**
- **Critical Geography**
- **Commons Theory**

The comparison is organized by thematic dimensions such as treatment of power, role of computation, spirituality, and design.

## 1. High-Level Comparison

| Dimension | Polymathmatic Geography | Quantitative Geography | Critical Geography | Commons Theory |
|----------|--------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Primary object of study | Entangled spaces: braided material, legal, economic, digital, genealogical, and spiritual relations in specific places | Spatial distributions and relationships of measurable phenomena (people, goods, land uses, flows) | Production of space under capitalism, colonialism, patriarchy, racialization, and other power structures | Shared resources (land, water, forests, fisheries, knowledge) and the institutions governing their use |
| Typical questions | How do power, value, and meaning move through an entangled space, and how can those flows be redesigned? | Where are things located, how are they distributed, and what factors explain observed spatial patterns? | Who benefits and who is harmed by existing spatial arrangements, and how are inequalities produced and maintained? | Under what rules and conditions can communities successfully share and steward a resource over time? |
| Typical methods | Braided: qualitative fieldwork, spiritual/genealogical mapping, institutional analysis, spatial statistics, network models, experimental design | Spatial statistics, GIS, modeling, optimization, remote sensing, survey analysis | Critical theory, political economy, discourse analysis, ethnography, historical and archival work | Case studies, institutional analysis, game theory, field experiments, historical and legal research |
| Normative stance | Explicitly normative: aims at care, justice, and accountable design for specific communities and places | Often implicitly normative but presented as neutral; emphasis on explanation, prediction, and efficiency | Explicitly normative: foregrounds critique of domination, exploitation, and marginalization | Often normative: concerned with sustainability, fairness, and resilience of shared resources |

## 2. Treatment of Power

| Dimension | Polymathmatic Geography | Quantitative Geography | Critical Geography | Commons Theory |
|----------|--------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| How power is conceptualized | Multi-layered: power is embedded in infrastructures, metrics, algorithms, laws, stories, rituals, and genealogies that shape movement and visibility | Typically via measurable proxies (e.g., accessibility, income, land use, service provision); power often implicit rather than central | Central category: power is structural (capital, state, empire, patriarchy) and ideological (discourses, representations) | Focused on institutional power: rules, enforcement, monitoring, sanctions, and the balance between state, market, and community |
| Level of analysis | From micro (household, congregation, neighborhood) to macro (platforms, financial systems), with emphasis on how they entangle in specific places | Often meso- to macro-scale (regions, cities, networks), emphasizing aggregated measures | Often macro‑structural but attentive to how structures are lived and contested in local settings | Often community- and resource-scale, with attention to nested governance (local, regional, national) |
| Role of critique | Critique plus construction: diagnoses harmful geographies and designs/test alternatives | Usually limited: critique appears when interpreting results, not built into method | Core mission: reveal and challenge domination, naturalized hierarchies, and taken‑for‑granted spatial orders | Critiques enclosure and privatization but often more focused on institutional design than broad ideological critique |

## 3. Role of Computation and Data

| Dimension | Polymathmatic Geography | Quantitative Geography | Critical Geography | Commons Theory |
|----------|--------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Role of computation | One tool among many; algorithms, databases, and AI systems are themselves geographic objects to be mapped, audited, and redesigned | Central; computation and statistics are primary means of producing knowledge about space | Important but often treated as external objects of critique (e.g., “platforms,” “surveillance”) rather than internal tools | Increasing use of models and simulations, but many core arguments remain non-computational and case‑study based |
| View of digital infrastructures | Part of the spatial fabric: clouds, platforms, AI systems, and metrics are organs of spatial power | Often treated as data sources or channels (e.g., mobile traces, remote sensing) rather than as spaces with their own politics | Objects of critique: digital capitalism, surveillance, data colonialism | Digital infrastructures increasingly relevant (e.g., open‑source platforms), but not always central in classic commons literature |
| Data selection | Explicitly contested: what is measured and omitted is treated as a moral and political choice to be made with communities | Often pre‑structured by available datasets; variable choice guided by statistical and methodological norms | Data selection itself is a site of critique; attention to whose data and categories are used | Data about resource use and governance often gathered for specific cases; choice shaped by institutional questions |

## 4. Spirituality, Genealogy, and Culture

| Dimension | Polymathmatic Geography | Quantitative Geography | Critical Geography | Commons Theory |
|----------|--------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Spirituality and sacred space | Treated as real geographies: beliefs, rituals, taboos, blessings, and covenants map constraints and obligations that shape what may happen where | Rarely modeled directly; spiritual variables may appear as proxies (e.g., “religious affiliation”) but often marginal | Religion and spirituality appear in some strands (e.g., postcolonial, cultural work), but often as one layer among many | Some attention to sacred groves, temple lands, church commons, but spirituality is not always a central analytic category |
| Genealogy and ancestry | Central: genealogies connect people to land, institutions, and obligations across time; cemeteries and family lands are core spatial objects | Occasionally included (e.g., demographic histories), but typically as background, not primary geometry | Important in some subfields (e.g., indigenous geographies, decolonial work), but not universally foregrounded | Lineage and tradition matter for legitimacy of claims and rules, but genealogies are not always mapped explicitly |
| Culture and narrative | Stories, symbols, and myths are treated as infrastructures that route attention, legitimacy, and memory; they are mapped alongside physical networks | Sometimes included via categorical variables (e.g., language, ethnicity), but narrative content rarely modeled | Central: discourses, representations, and meaning-making are core sites of power and resistance | Important for understanding trust, norms, and local legitimacy, especially in long‑standing commons, but often implicit |

## 5. Design and Intervention

| Dimension | Polymathmatic Geography | Quantitative Geography | Critical Geography | Commons Theory |
|----------|--------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| View of design | Design (of metrics, platforms, institutions, rituals) is a core geographic act; intentional re‑design of entangled spaces is part of the discipline | Frequently aims at optimization (e.g., site selection, service allocation) but may stop at recommending efficient configurations | Often skeptical of technocratic design; emphasizes participatory and emancipatory approaches, sometimes wary of formalization | Focuses on institutional design principles (rules, monitoring, sanctions, nested governance) to sustain shared resources |
| Typical interventions | New governance rules, alternative infrastructures, AI stewards, credit systems, and narrative practices co‑designed with communities | Policy recommendations, zoning changes, infrastructure placement, service allocation | Political action, movement building, policy critique, alternative narratives and practices | Rule reforms, new governance bodies, co‑management arrangements, legal recognition of commons |
| Evaluation criteria | Multi‑dimensional: statistical performance, lived experience, ethical and spiritual coherence, accountability to place and community | Statistical validity, predictive power, goodness‑of‑fit, robustness, sometimes cost‑effectiveness | Degree to which power relations are revealed, contested, or transformed; alignment with emancipatory goals | Sustainability, resilience, fairness, avoidance of tragedy of the commons, robustness to shocks |

## 6. Scale and Exportability

| Dimension | Polymathmatic Geography | Quantitative Geography | Critical Geography | Commons Theory |
|----------|--------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Preferred scales | From household and neighborhood to region and network, always grounded in specific places; emphasizes nested entanglements | Any scale where data exist: from local to global; often favors scales suited to available datasets | Often operates between local and global, connecting lived spaces to structural processes | Commonly local or regional resource systems, sometimes nested in higher‑level institutions |
| Exportability of insights | Designed to travel: principles and methods can apply to rural, urban, digital, and hybrid spaces if entanglement is mapped carefully | Highly exportable when phenomena are measurable and comparable across contexts | Exportable as critique and theory; specific empirical work may be context‑dependent | Exportable as design principles (e.g., Ostrom’s), but detailed governance solutions remain context‑specific |

## 7. Summary

Polymathmatic Geography does not replace quantitative geography, critical geography, or commons theory. Instead, it:

- **inherits** quantitative tools for pattern detection and modeling,  
- **inherits** critical attention to power and inequality,  
- **inherits** commons theory’s focus on shared resources and institutions,  

while adding:

- a formal commitment to *entanglement* as the basic condition of space,  
- an insistence on braiding qualitative, quantitative, spiritual, and genealogical evidence, and  
- a focus on intentional design and evaluation of new spatial arrangements.

This comparative view is meant to clarify how the discipline sits in relation to established traditions and to invite collaboration rather than disciplinary silos.

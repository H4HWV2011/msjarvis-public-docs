# Polymathmatic Geography and Human Geography

Polymathmatic Geography grows out of human geography but pushes it in three directions at once: toward formal, quantifiable models of entanglement; toward explicit engagement with computation and AI as spatial actors; and toward the inclusion of spiritual, genealogical, and designed infrastructures as first‑class geographic objects. This document sketches how the discipline extends, complements, and sometimes argues with three major strands: human geography, spatial statistics, and critical geography.

## 1. Relationship to Human Geography

Human geography studies how people make and experience places through culture, economy, politics, and everyday life. Polymathmatic Geography affirms this foundation but makes two strong additions.

1. **From “place and people” to “entangled spaces”**  
   Human geography has long treated place as a nexus of social relations, meanings, and material conditions. Polymathmatic Geography formalizes this intuition by treating every place as an entangled space: a web of material, informational, legal, economic, and spiritual relations that cannot be cleanly separated without losing what is most important. Where human geography often narrates these entanglements qualitatively, Polymathmatic Geography aims to represent them in ways that can be reasoned about across multiple modalities (for example, maps, narratives, graphs, and symbolic logics).

2. **Making design and computation explicit**  
   Human geographers increasingly study platforms, logistics, and data, but often keep the technical architectures in the background. Polymathmatic Geography pulls them into the foreground, treating the design of metrics, platforms, and credit systems as geographic acts. It does not only ask “how do people experience this infrastructure?” but also “how is this infrastructure mathematically and legally structured, and how does that structure re‑make the space?” In this sense, it asks human geography to claim responsibility for the design and critique of digital and institutional architectures, not just their social effects.

In practice, Polymathmatic Geography can be read as a branch of human geography that insists on:

- formalizing some of the relations human geographers already describe, and  
- expanding the list of “things in the landscape” to include algorithms, databases, protocols, and rituals alongside roads and buildings.

## 2. Relationship to Spatial Statistics

Spatial statistics provides tools for analyzing patterns, clusters, and relationships in geographic data. Polymathmatic Geography uses these tools but resists allowing them to define what counts as a valid question.

1. **Beyond correlation in coordinates**  
   Spatial statistics tends to treat observations as points, lines, or areas in a coordinate system, focusing on correlation, dependence, and prediction. Polymathmatic Geography accepts this as one layer but insists that many of the most important relations in a place are not visible as simple geometric proximity. Spiritual ties, genealogies, jurisdictional overlaps, and digital connectivity create “adjacencies” that are not captured by Euclidean distance. The discipline therefore treats statistical distance and topological distance as only one of several possible geometries.

2. **Metrics as contested choices**  
   Spatial statistics typically starts with variables that are already defined: income, land use class, traffic counts, and so on. Polymathmatic Geography asks where those variables came from and whose priorities they serve. It treats the selection and construction of variables as a moral and political act, not just a technical one. Instead of merely fitting models, it asks: what should be measured in this space to reflect the obligations and experiences of its inhabitants?

3. **Integration with non‑statistical evidence**  
   Spatial statistics is powerful when the world is well‑measured and regularized. Polymathmatic Geography often works where measurements are sparse, contested, or deeply shaped by power. In such settings, it uses spatial statistics as one strand in a braid that also includes oral histories, archive work, spiritual mapping, and institutional analysis. In cases of conflict, it does not automatically privilege statistical significance over other forms of evidence.

Seen this way, spatial statistics becomes one of the discipline’s toolkits, not its identity. Polymathmatic Geography argues for a more reflexive and participatory approach to modeling, in which residents and other disciplines have a say in what is modeled, at what scale, and to what end.

## 3. Relationship to Critical Geography

Critical geography foregrounds power, inequality, and ideology in the production of space. Polymathmatic Geography is aligned with this intention but adds three emphases.

1. **From critique to constructive design**  
   Critical geography excels at revealing how capitalist, colonial, racial, and patriarchal orders shape and exploit space. Polymathmatic Geography adopts this critical stance but insists that a discipline devoted to entangled spaces must also design and test alternatives. It treats new institutional, economic, and computational arrangements not just as case studies, but as experimental geographies whose performance can be evaluated and iterated. Critique and construction are both part of the work.

2. **Explicit treatment of computation and AI as spatial power**  
   Critical geography has increasingly engaged with digital capitalism, surveillance, and platforms, but often narrates them at a high level. Polymathmatic Geography asks for a finer granularity: How is an algorithm parameterized? How does a content moderation rule change who is visible in a place? How does a credit scoring model reroute capital locally? It treats code, models, and protocols as part of the spatial fabric to be mapped, debated, and redesigned.

3. **Inclusion of spiritual and genealogical dimensions of power**  
   Critical geography often centers economic and political structures, with culture and religion as secondary layers. Polymathmatic Geography insists that spiritual orders, covenantal relationships, and genealogical claims are themselves spatial structures of power and care. It does not assume that secular framings are more objective; instead, it treats the coexistence of secular and sacred orders as part of the entanglement to be studied.

In short, Polymathmatic Geography extends critical geography by attempting to:

- formalize some of the mechanisms of power in more technical detail (metrics, algorithms, infrastructures), and  
- widen the lens to include spiritual, genealogical, and designed systems as co‑equal with economic and political structures.

## 4. Why a Separate Name?

Given these overlaps, why not simply call this “a strand of human geography” or “critical digital geography”?

The name *Polymathmatic Geography* signals three things:

1. **Methodological plurality with formal rigor**  
   “Polymathmatic” indicates a deliberate weaving of qualitative, quantitative, spiritual, legal, and computational approaches, without collapsing them into a single hierarchy. At the same time, it aspires to the kind of clarity and explicitness associated with mathematical work: being precise about objects, relations, and assumptions.

2. **Geography as design space, not only object of study**  
   The discipline takes seriously the idea that geographers (and their collaborators) are designing new spatial arrangements—of data, law, economy, and care—not just describing existing ones. This moves design and institutional experimentation to the core of the discipline rather than leaving them to planners, engineers, or entrepreneurs.

3. **Commitment to entangled, accountable practice**  
   By naming entanglement and accountability as central, the field distinguishes itself from approaches that treat the digital as an overlay, the spiritual as private, or the economic as determinative. It calls for work that is answerable both to academic standards and to the communities whose spaces are being modeled and reshaped.

## 5. Collaboration, Not Replacement

Polymathmatic Geography is not proposed as a replacement for human geography, spatial statistics, or critical geography. Instead, it offers a meeting ground where:

- human geographers bring rich place‑based understanding,  
- spatial statisticians bring tools for pattern detection and uncertainty,  
- critical geographers bring analyses of power and ideology, and  
- designers, technologists, theologians, and community members bring their own languages and obligations.

The hope is that under this name, such collaborations can be structured more explicitly, with shared principles and methods for working in entangled spaces—whether those spaces are mountain hollers, financial districts, or digital commons.

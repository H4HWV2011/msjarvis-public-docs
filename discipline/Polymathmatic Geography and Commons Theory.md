# Polymathmatic Geography and Commons Theory

Commons theory studies how communities share, govern, and sometimes lose access to resources such as land, water, forests, and fisheries. Polymathmatic Geography builds on this work but treats commons not only as economic or legal arrangements, but as fully entangled spaces where material, legal, spiritual, genealogical, and symbolic layers interact. This document outlines how the polymathmatic lens can be applied to non‑digital commons such as medieval grazing rights, irrigation systems, and church lands.

## 1. Commons as Entangled Spaces

Classical commons theory often emphasizes three elements: the resource (e.g., a pasture), the community of users, and the governance rules that prevent overuse or enclosure. Polymathmatic Geography agrees with this triad but expands it.

For any commons, it asks:

- What are the **material flows** (grass growth, water volume, harvest cycles)?  
- What are the **legal and customary rules** (charters, customary rights, fines, boundaries)?  
- What are the **genealogical ties** (families, lineages, guilds, orders) that define who belongs?  
- What are the **spiritual and symbolic orders** (blessings, saints, rituals, festivals) that sanctify or constrain use?  
- What are the **narratives and myths** that explain why this commons exists and what it means?  

By treating all of these as part of one geography, the discipline reads commons not just as economic arrangements, but as complex spatial bodies whose organs include law, story, and spirit.

## 2. Medieval Grazing Rights

Consider a medieval common pasture where villagers hold shared rights to graze animals.

### 2.1 Layers in the landscape

A polymathmatic reading identifies at least five layers:

- **Material** – Soil quality, grass growth rates, water access, paths taken by herds.  
- **Legal/customary** – Who has the right to graze, how many animals each household may keep, seasonal restrictions, penalties for overuse or trespass.  
- **Genealogical** – Families whose rights are inherited, sometimes tied to particular farmsteads or surnames.  
- **Spiritual** – Patron saints of the village, harvest blessings, taboos on working certain days, processions that literally trace the boundaries (“beating the bounds”).  
- **Narrative** – Stories about how the commons was granted (a lord’s charter, a king’s favor, ancestral defense); songs or tales that encode expectations of fairness and duty.

### 2.2 Questions in the polymathmatic frame

Polymathmatic Geography asks:

- How do the **grazing rules** and genealogical entitlements shape the *geometry of obligation*—who owes care to which parts of the land, and who may be excluded?  
- How do **spiritual practices** (blessings, processions, feast days) reinforce or contest the boundaries of the commons over time?  
- How does the **timing** of use (seasonal cycles of grazing and fallow) interact with both ecological and liturgical calendars?  

Instead of focusing only on overuse or enclosure, the analysis maps how power, belonging, and sacredness are distributed across the shared pasture, and how that distribution changes when a lord tries to enclose it or convert it into private fields.

## 3. Irrigation Systems and Water Commons

Traditional irrigation systems—such as canal networks in arid regions—are classic commons, often governed by intricate local rules.

### 3.1 Entangled flows

A polymathmatic approach sees:

- **Physical flows** – Water volume, flow rates, evaporation, silt accumulation.  
- **Engineered structures** – Canals, gates, diversion channels, storage basins.  
- **Institutional rules** – Turn‑taking schedules, emergency allocations in drought, maintenance obligations, conflict resolution forums.  
- **Genealogical and social ties** – Families or villages associated with particular canal branches or gate responsibilities.  
- **Spiritual frameworks** – Rain rituals, water deities, sacred springs, prohibitions on polluting certain segments, festivals marking planting or flood cycles.

### 3.2 Polymathmatic questions

The discipline might ask:

- How do **timing rules** for water turns create a temporal geometry of privilege and vulnerability along the canal?  
- How do **stories and rituals about water** help stabilize trust in times of scarcity, or alternatively, justify unequal access?  
- How do **maintenance obligations** travel along kinship networks or local institutions, and what happens when those networks weaken?  

Again, the focus is not only on whether the water commons is “efficient,” but on how the entangled space of canals, rules, families, and rituals sustains or erodes mutual obligations.

## 4. Church Lands and Sacred Commons

Church lands, monastic estates, and sacred groves often functioned as commons: spaces with layered rights of use (e.g., gathering firewood, grazing animals, holding markets) under ecclesiastical authority.

### 4.1 Multiple jurisdictions

A polymathmatic reading highlights:

- **Dual authority** – Overlapping secular and ecclesiastical jurisdictions, each with its own laws and courts.  
- **Mixed uses** – Prayer, pilgrimage, agriculture, charity, education, and shelter coexisting on the same lands.  
- **Spiritual economy** – Tithes, alms, indulgences, and endowments creating a flow of value tied to spiritual commitments.  
- **Symbolic centrality** – The church or monastery as a focal point in mental maps of the region; processions and feast days radiating out into surrounding fields.

### 4.2 Questions of power and care

Polymathmatic Geography asks:

- How does the **sacred status** of land constrain or enable its use as a commons (e.g., protection from certain forms of enclosure, but also exclusion of non‑members)?  
- How do **liturgical calendars** structure access and obligations (e.g., harvest festivals, days of rest, periods of fasting that alter demand)?  
- How do **stories of foundation** (a saint’s miracle, a noble’s donation, a vow fulfilled) shape local expectations about who the land is “for”?  

Here, the commons is not only a resource pool but a node in a spiritual and narrative network; enclosure or secularization changes both economic and metaphysical geographies.

## 5. Commons, Enclosure, and Entangled Loss

Historical accounts of enclosure often describe loss in economic or legal terms: people lose grazing rights or access to forests. The polymathmatic lens emphasizes additional layers of loss:

- Loss of **spatial memory**, when paths, boundaries, and gathering places disappear.  
- Loss of **ritual routes**, when processions and festivals can no longer cross privatized land.  
- Loss of **genealogical continuity**, when families are cut off from places tied to their names, graves, or stories.  
- Loss of **collective agency**, when decision‑making about the commons is replaced by distant or opaque authority.

By mapping these layers, the discipline can make visible why enclosure and privatization often feel like more than just economic change—they are re‑writings of shared worlds.

## 6. Lessons for Contemporary Commons

Although the examples above are pre‑digital, they point to general insights that Polymathmatic Geography carries into modern work:

- **Commons are multi‑layered by nature.** It is a mistake to treat them purely as resource pools or legal regimes; spiritual, genealogical, and symbolic structures are integral, not optional.  
- **Metrics must honor entanglement.** Any attempt to “measure” the health or value of a commons should account, as far as possible, for these multiple layers, or at least be honest about which ones are being left out.  
- **Design choices are historical actors.** Changes in rules, boundaries, calendars, or narratives are as consequential as changes in infrastructure, and should be studied with equal care.

By applying its lens to non‑digital commons, Polymathmatic Geography situates itself in a long tradition of thinking about shared resources and shared obligations. It does not start with blockchains or AI; it starts with the recognition that commons have always been entangled spaces—and that any attempt to repair or reinvent them must work across all their layers at once.

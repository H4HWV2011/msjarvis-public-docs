# Non-Digital Commons in a Polymathmatic Lens

This document applies Polymathmatic Geography to non‑digital commons: physical systems where communities have historically shared land, water, and sacred spaces without blockchains or artificial intelligence. It focuses on four families of examples:

- English common land and enclosure  
- Quaker meeting commons in early Pennsylvania (Biles, Janney)  
- Traditional irrigation systems (Spanish huertas)  
- Sacred forests and church-associated commons  

In each case, the commons is treated as an *entangled space* where material flows, legal rules, genealogies, and spiritual or symbolic orders are woven together.

## 1. Mesopotamian Ledgers and Appalachian Design

### 1.1 Why these commons matter for Appalachia

This non‑digital survey is not antiquarian; it is a **design toolkit** for contemporary Appalachia. Each case is a lens on questions The Commons, MountainShares, and Ms. Jarvis must answer:

- Who can see and shape the rules of access to shared resources (land, water, code, data)?  
- How are obligations, debts, and harms recorded—in ledgers, stories, or both?  
- Which lineages and communities are recognized as having standing, and which are erased?

English enclosure shows how quickly shared subsistence geographies can be rewritten into private parcels once legal and surveying instruments align. Quaker Pennsylvania shows a spiritual–legal commons that can admonish powerful members while still participating in settler‑colonial expansion. Mediterranean huertas show how time‑based rights and open tribunals hold a water commons together across generations. Sacred forests show how spiritual meaning and ritual can protect ecological structure as effectively as statute.

Polymathmatic Geography treats today’s digital and financial infrastructures in Appalachia as continuations of these struggles. MountainShares’ parameter tables, The Commons’ moderation rules, and Ms. Jarvis’s geospatial belief model are modern instruments that can either re‑enact enclosure or sustain new, accountable commons.

### 1.2 Temple Ledgers and Barley Credit in Ancient Mesopotamia

Long before English enclosure or Quaker meeting commons, Mesopotamian cities such as Ur, Babylon, and Nineveh ran complex exchange systems that combined **barter, commodity money, and credit**.

- Temples and palaces served as **central warehouses and ledgers**, recording obligations in standardized measures of barley and silver.  
- Farmers and herders received grain advances, paid back after harvest with interest; merchants operated under written contracts specifying quantities, qualities, and repayment terms.  
- Prices for staple goods and services were tracked over time, revealing structured markets rather than ad‑hoc swaps.  

Contrary to the popular “pure barter before money” story, historians and cuneiform scholars point out that:

- Barter existed, especially at the household level, but **large‑scale trade was mediated by credit and written contracts** rather than simple spot exchange.  
- Debts and interest were recorded on clay tablets, with regularities that look more like a **proto‑accounting system** than a casual gift economy.  

From a polymathmatic perspective, temple–palace economies form an early **ledgered commons**:

- **Material** – Grain stores, herds, and labor obligations physically concentrated in temple and palace complexes.  
- **Legal/institutional** – Codified rules (for example, in the Code of Hammurabi) governing loans, interest, wages, and collateral, enforced by courts and officials.  
- **Genealogical** – Families and lineages tied to particular fields, work obligations, and debtor/creditor positions across generations.  
- **Symbolic/ritual** – Offerings, festivals, and royal inscriptions that present the ruler as guarantor of justice, balance, and right measurement.  

This Mesopotamian ledgered commons is a distant ancestor of modern accounting and banking, but it also rhymes with today’s blockchain and DAO experiments: an attempt to bind economic behavior to a visible, rule‑governed record. For Polymathmatic Geography, it is a reminder that **commons and ledgers have been intertwined for millennia**, and that the question is not whether we keep ledgers, but **who they serve and who can read and contest them**.

### 1.3 Edward I and the Dark Geometry of Power

For this project, there is a direct genealogical thread into English statecraft: Edward I (“Longshanks”) is a distant ancestor of the author. His reign offers a stark example of how a single sovereign can re‑wire land, law, and lineage as one entangled system.

Two clusters are especially important:

- **Royal forests and the shrinking of common use**  
  Norman and Plantagenet kings declared vast areas as “royal forests,” a legal category that often included villages, fields, and heaths, not just woodland. Under forest law, traditional uses like hunting, wood‑gathering, and grazing could become criminal acts. By the late 13th century, Edward I was forced to “deforest” large tracts and confirm forest charters, but even these reforms took for granted a world where a royal word could convert lived commons into restricted zones.  
  In Polymathmatic terms, this is a **state enclosure geometry**: a line on a map that simultaneously changes material flows (who can eat), legal exposure (who can be punished), genealogical continuity (which families keep or lose customary rights), and symbolic order (the king’s “green world” as a visible stamp of power).  

- **Castles, planted towns, and the conquest of Wales**  
  Edward’s conquest of Wales was followed by a ring of stone castles—Caernarfon, Conwy, Harlech, Beaumaris—often paired with new English boroughs. These were not just military outposts; they were **planned spatial instruments** that redirected trade, administration, and settlement into English‑controlled nodes. Welsh legal traditions were displaced or subordinated to English borough charters; Welsh lineages were pushed off prime river and coastal sites; the skyline itself was re‑inscribed with royal walls and towers.  

Polymathmatic Geography sees this as a **top‑down reprogramming of a regional commons**: material circuits (tax, grain, labor), legal frameworks, genealogies, and symbols all bent toward imperial consolidation. Being descended from Edward I means this work does not approach enclosure, colonization, or forest law as abstractions; it treats them as part of a **family archive of geometry and power** that must be named, studied, and, where possible, counter‑engineered—so that new commons in Appalachia are built with full awareness of the old maps they are trying to heal.

## 2. English Common Land and Enclosure

### 2.1 The commons before enclosure

In England, medieval and early modern villages often relied on open fields and common land where tenants had customary rights to graze animals, collect wood, or mow hay. These rights were embedded in the manorial system and local practice, not simply in written statute. Before large‑scale enclosure, common land occupied a substantial share of the rural landscape and underpinned subsistence for many households.  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure)  
[https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-hccc-worldhistory2/chapter/the-enclosure-act/](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-hccc-worldhistory2/chapter/the-enclosure-act/)

From a polymathmatic perspective, these commons were already entangled spaces:

- **Material/economic** – Shared pastures, meadows, and woodlands supporting mixed farming systems.  
- **Legal/customary** – Manorial courts, customary rights of common, and informal agreements among tenants.  
- **Genealogical** – Family claims to particular strips, homesteads, and use rights passed down across generations.  
- **Symbolic/ritual** – Practices such as “beating the bounds,” in which parishioners walked and marked boundaries, embedding them in memory and story.  

For enclosure awards, maps, and records, see:  
[https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/enclosure-awards/](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/enclosure-awards/)

### 2.2 Enclosure as spatial re-writing

Between 1604 and 1914, more than 5,200 enclosure acts converted millions of acres of common and open-field land into privately controlled parcels, often fenced or hedged. This process did not merely change ownership; it re‑wrote the geometry of obligation and access.  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure)  
[https://www.thelandmagazine.org.uk/articles/short-history-enclosure-britain](https://www.thelandmagazine.org.uk/articles/short-history-enclosure-britain)

Key polymathmatic observations:

- **Loss of shared access** – Rights to graze, gather, or mow were extinguished or sharply restricted.  
- **Realignment of power** – Land and decision‑making shifted toward larger landowners and away from smallholders and landless commoners.  
- **Erosion of ritual and memory** – Traditional routes and boundaries disappeared, altering how people moved through and remembered the land.  

Polymathmatic Geography reads enclosure as a reconfiguration of an entangled space: a change in legal and material structure that also breaks genealogical continuity and erases shared stories. This helps explain why enclosure is experienced as more than an economic loss; it is a loss of a world.

## 3. Quaker Meeting Commons in Early Pennsylvania (Biles, Janney)

### 3.1 Meetings, land, and discipline as commons

When Quakers carried their practices from England to Pennsylvania, they created new commons centered on meetinghouses, burial grounds, and shared lands, governed by both civil grants and religious discipline.

Bucks County histories describe **William Biles** as an early settler, lawyer, large landholder, and Quaker leader who served on Pennsylvania’s Provincial Council and Assembly. His lands and legal work shaped the geometry of early townships and riverfront settlement.  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Biles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Biles)  

**Thomas Janney**, a Quaker minister from Cheshire, emigrated under William Penn’s encouragement and helped select sites for meetings and settlements in Bucks County. Genealogical and county sources list him among the Friends tasked with locating “a convenient place” for meetings and community development.  
[http://freepages.rootsweb.com/~mcstayfamily/genealogy/janney.htm](http://freepages.rootsweb.com/~mcstayfamily/genealogy/janney.htm)  
[https://pagenweb.org/~bucks/BIOS_DAVIS/thomasjanney.html](https://pagenweb.org/~bucks/BIOS_DAVIS/thomasjanney.html)  

The author is the 8th great‑granddaughter of both Biles and Janney, so the spaces they surveyed, argued over, and prayed in are not just historical case studies but part of a living **family commons** that still shapes how Appalachian design problems are approached.

Seen polymathmatically, these early Quaker spaces in Pennsylvania were commons in at least four entangled layers:

- **Material/economic** – Shared meetinghouses, burial grounds, and sometimes common grazing or woodlots tied to the meeting.  
- **Legal/spiritual** – Quaker discipline (meetings for business, admonitions, disownments) acting as an internal court over members’ conduct.  
- **Genealogical** – Families like the Biles and Janney lines embedded in particular meetings and tracts over generations.  
- **Symbolic/narrative** – Stories of persecution, ministry, and admonition (for example, elders confronting Biles over selling rum to Indigenous people) that encode boundaries of acceptable conduct in the commons.

### 3.2 Accountability and power inside a settler commons

This Quaker commons is not a simple egalitarian space; it is a site where power, conscience, and colonial expansion are negotiated.

Bucks County Quaker histories and meeting narratives recount how Friends, including ministers like Janney, admonished Biles about selling rum to Indigenous people, treating it as a serious breach of discipline rather than a private business choice. The same man who was a judge, legislator, and major landholder could be called to account by his meeting, illustrating a form of **internal accountability to a spiritual-legal order** within an emerging settler commons.  
[https://www.fallsingtonmeeting.org/quaker-history/our-history](https://www.fallsingtonmeeting.org/quaker-history/our-history)  

Polymathmatic Geography reads this as:

- A **commons of conscience**, where spiritual authority constrains economic acts that would otherwise exploit vulnerable groups.  
- A **settler-colonial commons**, where land acquisition and town planning proceed inside a framework that partially regulates, but does not erase, colonial asymmetries with Indigenous nations.  
- A **genealogical and spiritual pipeline** that ties present‑day descendants back to specific decisions, admonitions, and spatial choices in the 17th and 18th centuries.  

This makes early Quaker Pennsylvania a bridge between European enclosure histories and contemporary attempts (like MountainShares and The Commons) to construct accountable, place‑bound institutions in Appalachia.

## 4. Irrigation Huertas as Water Commons

### 4.1 La Huerta de Valencia and Huerta de Murcia

Mediterranean irrigation systems such as the huerta of Valencia and Murcia in Spain are classic water commons: intricate networks of canals (acequias) that distribute river water to thousands of small plots under shared rules.  
[https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20220220-valencias-la-huerta-spains-ingenious-water-maze](https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20220220-valencias-la-huerta-spains-ingenious-water-maze)  
[https://theurbanactivist.com/governance/the-council-of-good-men-huerta-murcia/](https://theurbanactivist.com/governance/the-council-of-good-men-huerta-murcia/)

Key features include:

- **Gravity-fed networks** – Main canals divert water from rivers like the Turia or Segura into branching channels feeding mosaic fields.  
- **Time-based rights** – Water rights are often defined by time slots, giving each irrigator a proportion of flow during a cycle rather than a fixed volume.  
- **Self-governing institutions** – Bodies like the Tribunal de las Aguas de Valencia and the Consejo de Hombres Buenos in Murcia adjudicate disputes and enforce rules with deep historical legitimacy.

[https://www.water-alternatives.org/index.php/alldoc/articles/vol4/v4issue3/142-a4-3-1/file](https://www.water-alternatives.org/index.php/alldoc/articles/vol4/v4issue3/142-a4-3-1/file)  
[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joac.12042](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joac.12042)  

### 4.2 Entangled irrigation geographies

Through a polymathmatic lens, these water commons are more than hydraulic engineering:

- **Material** – Flow rates, soil moisture, and recharge of aquifers through flood irrigation.  
- **Legal/institutional** – Ordinances, customary law, and regular public tribunals that meet at visible, symbolic locations.  
- **Genealogical/social** – Families and lineages tied to particular channels, rights, and maintenance responsibilities.  
- **Symbolic/ritual** – Seasonal rhythms of planting and harvest, market days, and local festivals that depend on the irrigation calendar.

Key questions include:

- How do time‑based water rights shape a temporal geometry of privilege and vulnerability along the canals?  
- How do visible, ritualized courts (like the open‑air water tribunals) sustain trust and compliance?  
- How do changes in state water policy or climate affect not just yields, but the social and narrative fabric of the huerta?

## 5. Sacred Forests and Church-Associated Commons

### 5.1 Sacred groves and church forests

Across Europe and parts of Asia, forests and groves associated with religious sites have functioned as commons governed by spiritual as well as legal rules. Examples include:

- Ancient sacred groves protected by specific religious laws and customs.  
- Monastic and church-managed forests where harvesting and grazing are regulated by religious norms and internal rules.  
- Church-centered forests where grazing or fodder collection is allowed only after specific feast days.

For empirical studies and case collections, see:

### 5.2 Spiritual orders as governance

Polymathmatic Geography treats these as commons whose governance is inseparable from spiritual orders:

- **Material/ecological** – Forest structure, biodiversity, and grazing regimes influenced by restrictions on cutting and seasonal access.  
- **Legal/spiritual** – Written laws and unwritten taboos that encode transgressions as both legal and religious offenses, with sanctions that may include ritual obligations.  
- **Genealogical/community** – Longstanding relationships between local families, religious communities, and particular trees, paths, and clearings.  
- **Symbolic** – Icons, shrines, and processional routes that anchor collective memory to specific forest features.

Questions in this frame include:

- How do spiritual prohibitions and blessings act as informal enforcement mechanisms for commons rules?  
- How does the presence of sacred meaning change the likelihood or impact of enclosure and commercial exploitation?  
- How do annual rituals (like the opening of grazing after a feast) maintain both ecological cycles and social cohesion?

---

## 6. Enclosure and Transformation of Non-Digital Commons

Historical and contemporary processes—such as Parliamentary enclosure, state water concessions, urbanization, and secularization—have transformed many of these commons.

For English commons:  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure)  
[https://www.thelandmagazine.org.uk/articles/short-history-enclosure-britain](https://www.thelandmagazine.org.uk/articles/short-history-enclosure-britain)  

For irrigation commons under pressure:  
[https://www.water-alternatives.org/index.php/alldoc/articles/vol4/v4issue3/142-a4-3-1/file](https://www.water-alternatives.org/index.php/alldoc/articles/vol4/v4issue3/142-a4-3-1/file)  

For sacred sites and modern pressures:  
[https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol27/iss4/art20/](https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol27/iss4/art20/)  
[https://www.silene.ong/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Linking_Biocultural_Diversity_and_Sacred_Sites_Europe.pdf](https://www.silene.ong/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Linking_Biocultural_Diversity_and_Sacred_Sites_Europe.pdf)  

In each case, Polymathmatic Geography tracks:

- **Which layers change first** – legal rights, infrastructure, or narratives.  
- **How entanglement is reconfigured** – for example, when forest spirituality is displaced or absorbed into new religious or economic structures.  
- **What forms of resistance or adaptation emerge** – from direct action against enclosure in Britain to local defense of sacred sites and irrigation customs.

The Quaker/Pennsylvania cases (Biles, Janney) illustrate how spiritual governance, landholding, and community discipline can function as a commons even inside an expanding settler-colonial world, and how those patterns echo forward into contemporary attempts to design accountable, place‑bound digital and economic systems.

  ## 8. Contemporary Appalachian Commons as Design Labs

The historical commons above are not just analogies; they have living relatives in today’s Appalachia. Several initiatives in the region already function as non‑digital commons—shared infrastructures of work, culture, land, and care—whose design choices can directly inform MountainShares, The Commons, and Ms. Jarvis.

### 8.1 The Industrial Commons: Cooperative Learning Journey as Commons School

The Industrial Commons in Morganton, North Carolina, is explicitly rebuilding “a diverse working class…based on locally-rooted wealth” through community-owned enterprises, land initiatives, and cooperative finance. Its Cooperative Learning Journey brings practitioners, funders, and local leaders into a multi‑day immersion where they walk the Innovation Campus, meet worker‑owners, and study TIC’s Rural Wealth Blueprint and Build–Buy–Leverage approach.

- TIC overview and mission: https://www.theindustrialcommons.org  
- Cooperative Learning Journey: https://www.theindustrialcommons.org/cooperative-model-journey  

Polymathmatic Geography can treat this Learning Journey as a commons school:

- **Material** – A redeveloped factory brownfield, emerging cooperative housing, and worker‑owned businesses sharing equipment, space, and credit.  
- **Legal/institutional** – Capital for the Commons and Land for the Commons operating like a ledgered commons: loans circulate within a defined ecosystem instead of exiting to distant investors.  
- **Genealogical/social** – Former frontline workers and local families anchoring governance, much like huerta irrigators or Quaker elders.  
- **Symbolic/ritual** – The journey itself as a ritualized “pilgrimage” into a new rural wealth geometry, echoing visits to historic fields, tribunals, and sacred forests.

For Ms. Jarvis and MountainShares, TIC’s Learning Journey becomes a field protocol: how do we invite people into a working commons as learners, not just users?

---

### 8.2 Sync Space and Heath Guinn: Regional Ecosystem Commons

Sync Space, based in the Appalachian Highlands, functions as an entrepreneurial commons for a four‑state region—connecting founders, mentors, capital, and institutions across northeast Tennessee, southwest Virginia, western North Carolina, and eastern Kentucky. Under President Heath Guinn’s leadership (Leadership Tennessee Class VII), Sync Space has helped knit together 22 counties, universities, healthcare systems, and investors into a shared platform for rural innovation.

- Sync Space overview: https://syncspace.org  
- Leadership Tennessee announcement:  
  https://syncspace.org/heath-guinn-president-of-sync-space-selected-for-leadership-tennessee-class-vii  

Through a polymathmatic lens, Sync Space is:

- **Material/economic** – Shared access to programs, capital, and markets that would be unreachable by isolated founders.  
- **Legal/institutional** – MOUs, accelerator programs, and partnerships that turn separate jurisdictions into a coordinated ecosystem.  
- **Genealogical/regional** – A new “kinship map” of towns and counties linked by entrepreneurial pathways over the mountains.  
- **Symbolic** – Stories of Appalachian tech and social enterprise that contest inherited narratives of extraction and decline.

For MountainShares, Sync Space models how to stitch counties into one ledgered commons without erasing local identity.

---

### 8.3 Coalfield Development and Brandon Dennison: 33‑6‑3 as Time Commons

Coalfield Development, operating in southern West Virginia, has pioneered the 33‑6‑3 model: 33 hours of paid work, 6 hours of higher education, and 3 hours of personal development each week for crew members. This structure ties green social enterprises (solar, construction, agriculture, reuse) to a holistic re‑commonsing of time, skills, and dignity for people exiting coal, incarceration, or addiction.

- Coalfield Development overview: https://coalfield-development.org  
- Brandon Dennison bio: https://coalfield-development.org/bio-brandon-dennison  

Polymathmatic Geography reads 33‑6‑3 as a time‑based commons, akin to huerta water rotations:

- **Material** – Wages, tools, and production embedded in social enterprises rather than extractive employers.  
- **Temporal/legal** – A fixed weekly rhythm that guarantees learning and healing time, not just labor extraction.  
- **Genealogical** – Multi‑year cohorts whose trajectories shift family histories of precarious work and exclusion.  
- **Symbolic** – A new narrative of “a good job” in coalfield counties: one that includes education, recovery, and agency as non‑negotiable.

For The Commons and Ms. Jarvis, Coalfield poses a key design question: how might digital systems protect and encode time for learning and care, not just optimize throughput?

---

### 8.4 Appalshop / Appalachian Media Institute: Narrative Commons

Appalshop’s Appalachian Media Institute (AMI) in Whitesburg, Kentucky, has, since 1988, trained hundreds of young people to document their communities through film, audio, and digital media. Youth producers share equipment, editing infrastructure, and mentorship as they tell stories about coal, floods, music, environment, and everyday life, building a regional media commons that counters extractive outside portrayals.

- Appalshop overview: https://appalshop.org  
- Appalachian Media Institute: https://www.amiappalshop.org  

Seen polymathmatically, AMI is:

- **Material** – Cameras, studios, and broadcast infrastructure held in common for local youth and communities.  
- **Legal/institutional** – Community-rooted editorial practices, consent norms, and archiving agreements that govern who tells what, and how.  
- **Genealogical** – Mentorship chains where former AMI participants return as trainers and staff, carrying forward place‑based knowledge.  
- **Symbolic** – A counter‑archive that lets Appalachians see themselves as authors and experts, not just subjects of outside documentaries.

This is the narrative twin of The Commons: one works on content‑creator rights and ethical distribution in a digital realm; the other has decades of practice in youth‑governed storytelling infrastructure on the ground.

---

### 8.5 Appalachian Rekindling Project: Rematriated Land Commons

The Appalachian Rekindling Project (ARP) seeks to establish an intertribal Indigenous center and land‑based hub in central Appalachia, where Native people can return, gather, and care for land collectively. The project explicitly frames its work as rematriation—restoring Indigenous women‑led relationships between people and ancestral land—alongside plans for bison reintroduction and land stewardship rooted in Indigenous law and ceremony.

- Appalachian Rekindling Project: https://www.appalachianrekindlingproject.org  

Polymathmatic Geography sees ARP as:

- **Material/ecological** – Land held in collective Indigenous care, with bison and other species returning to landscapes shaped by extraction and dispossession.  
- **Legal/sovereign** – Governance grounded in Indigenous law, treaty awareness, and intertribal protocols, not just state property codes.  
- **Genealogical** – Reconnecting displaced families and nations to specific hollows, ridges, and watersheds in central Appalachia.  
- **Symbolic/ritual** – Ceremonies, language use, and story that explicitly heal histories of removal and enclosure.

For MountainShares and The Commons, ARP is a necessary constraint and teacher: any Appalachian commons architecture must avoid replaying settler‑colonial erasure by centering Indigenous sovereignty and leadership in land‑based projects, or risk becoming another layer of enclosure with better branding.

---

In this way, The Industrial Commons, Sync Space, Coalfield Development, Appalshop/AMI, and the Appalachian Rekindling Project become **live production labs** for non‑digital commons in Appalachia. Their practice offers concrete patterns—governance rhythms, institutional forms, narrative protocols, and spatial arrangements—that Polymathmatic Geography can formalize, and that MountainShares, The Commons, and Ms. Jarvis can encode into new but historically aware infrastructures.

# Non-Digital Commons in a Polymathmatic Lens

This document applies Polymathmatic Geography to non‑digital commons: physical systems where communities have historically shared land, water, and sacred spaces without blockchains or artificial intelligence. It focuses on three families of examples:

- English common land and enclosure  
- Traditional irrigation systems (Spanish huertas)  
- Sacred forests and church-associated commons  

In each case, the commons is treated as an *entangled space* where material flows, legal rules, genealogies, and spiritual or symbolic orders are woven together.

## 1. English Common Land and Enclosure

### 1.1 The commons before enclosure

In England, medieval and early modern villages often relied on open fields and common land where tenants had customary rights to graze animals, collect wood, or mow hay. These rights were embedded in the manorial system and local practice, not simply in written statute. Before large‑scale enclosure, common land occupied a substantial share of the rural landscape and underpinned subsistence for many households.

From a polymathmatic perspective, these commons were already entangled spaces:

- **Material/economic** – Shared pastures, meadows, and woodlands supporting mixed farming systems.  
- **Legal/customary** – Manorial courts, customary rights of common, and informal agreements among tenants.  
- **Genealogical** – Family claims to particular strips, homesteads, and use rights passed down across generations.  
- **Symbolic/ritual** – Practices such as “beating the bounds,” in which parishioners walked and marked boundaries, embedding them in memory and story.

### 1.2 Enclosure as spatial re-writing

Between 1604 and 1914, more than 5,200 enclosure acts converted millions of acres of common and open-field land into privately controlled parcels, often fenced or hedged. This process did not merely change ownership; it re‑wrote the geometry of obligation and access.

https://www.thelandmagazine.org.uk/articles/short-history-enclosure-britain

Key polymathmatic observations:

- **Loss of shared access** – Rights to graze, gather, or mow were extinguished or sharply restricted.  
- **Realignment of power** – Land and decision‑making shifted toward larger landowners and away from smallholders and landless commoners.  
- **Erosion of ritual and memory** – Traditional routes and boundaries disappeared, altering how people moved through and remembered the land.

Polymathmatic Geography reads enclosure as a reconfiguration of an entangled space: a change in legal and material structure that also breaks genealogical continuity and erases shared stories. This helps explain why enclosure is experienced as more than an economic loss; it is a loss of a world.

## 2. Irrigation Huertas as Water Commons

### 2.1 La Huerta de Valencia and Huerta de Murcia

Mediterranean irrigation systems such as the huerta of Valencia and Murcia in Spain are classic water commons: intricate networks of canals (acequias) that distribute river water to thousands of small plots under shared rules.

https://theurbanactivist.com/governance/the-council-of-good-men-huerta-murcia/

Key features include:

- **Gravity-fed networks** – Main canals divert water from rivers like the Turia or Segura into branching channels feeding mosaic fields.  
- **Time-based rights** – Water rights are often defined by time slots, giving each irrigator a proportion of flow during a cycle rather than a fixed volume.  
- **Self-governing institutions** – Bodies like the Tribunal de las Aguas de Valencia and the Consejo de Hombres Buenos in Murcia adjudicate disputes and enforce rules with deep historical legitimacy.

### 2.2 Entangled irrigation geographies

Through a polymathmatic lens, these water commons are more than hydraulic engineering:

- **Material** – Flow rates, soil moisture, and recharge of aquifers through flood irrigation.  
- **Legal/institutional** – Ordinances, customary law, and regular public tribunals that meet at visible, symbolic locations.  
- **Genealogical/social** – Families and lineages tied to particular channels, rights, and maintenance responsibilities.  
- **Symbolic/ritual** – Seasonal rhythms of planting and harvest, market days, and local festivals that depend on the irrigation calendar.

Key questions include:

- How do time‑based water rights shape a temporal geometry of privilege and vulnerability along the canals?  
- How do visible, ritualized courts (like the open‑air water tribunals) sustain trust and compliance?  
- How do changes in state water policy or climate affect not just yields, but the social and narrative fabric of the huerta?

## 3. Sacred Forests and Church-Associated Commons

### 3.1 Sacred groves and church forests

Across Europe and parts of Asia, forests and groves associated with religious sites have functioned as commons governed by spiritual as well as legal rules. Examples include:

- Ancient sacred groves protected by specific religious laws and customs.  
- Monastic and church-managed forests where harvesting and grazing are regulated by religious norms and internal rules.  
- Church-centered forests where grazing or fodder collection is allowed only after specific feast days.

### 3.2 Spiritual orders as governance

Polymathmatic Geography treats these as commons whose governance is inseparable from spiritual orders:

- **Material/ecological** – Forest structure, biodiversity, and grazing regimes influenced by restrictions on cutting and seasonal access.  
- **Legal/spiritual** – Written laws and unwritten taboos that encode transgressions as both legal and religious offenses, with sanctions that may include ritual obligations.  
- **Genealogical/community** – Longstanding relationships between local families, religious communities, and particular trees, paths, and clearings.  
- **Symbolic** – Icons, shrines, and processional routes that anchor collective memory to specific forest features.

Questions in this frame include:

- How do spiritual prohibitions and blessings act as informal enforcement mechanisms for commons rules?  
- How does the presence of sacred meaning change the likelihood or impact of enclosure and commercial exploitation?  
- How do annual rituals (like the opening of grazing after a feast) maintain both ecological cycles and social cohesion?

## 4. Enclosure and Transformation of Non-Digital Commons

Historical and contemporary processes—such as Parliamentary enclosure, state water concessions, urbanization, and secularization—have transformed many of these commons.

https://www.silene.ong/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Linking_Biocultural_Diversity_and_Sacred_Sites_Europe.pdf  

In each case, Polymathmatic Geography tracks:

- **Which layers change first** – legal rights, infrastructure, or narratives.  
- **How entanglement is reconfigured** – for example, when forest spirituality is displaced or absorbed into new religious or economic structures.  
- **What forms of resistance or adaptation emerge** – from direct action against enclosure in Britain to local defense of sacred sites and irrigation customs.

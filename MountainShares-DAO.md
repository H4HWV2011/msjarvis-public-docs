# MountainShares DAO

MountainShares is a DAO-based economic and governance system intended to keep value, voice, and decision-making rooted in Appalachian communities, beginning in and around Mount Hope, West Virginia. It operates as a community-governed project and does not replace or act as a bank, credit union, or regulated financial institution.

## Purpose

- Encourage more economic activity and value circulation within participating local communities, rather than defaulting to distant financial and platform intermediaries.
- Give residents, nonprofits, and local businesses a documented, auditable role in shaping shared rules, resource allocation, and priorities.
- Provide a constitutional and transparent governance layer around the system’s rules and technologies while remaining subject to applicable law and regulation.

## Relationship to Ms. Jarvis

- Ms. Egeria Jarvis is designed to function as an aligned, “glassbox” AI advisor and tooling layer for MountainShares governance and operations, not as an ultimate authority or owner.
- AI behavior is constrained by published constitutional principles, technical safeguards, and human-approved policies. Ms. Jarvis can surface information, analysis, and recommendations, but final decisions are made by human participants and/or designated governance bodies in accordance with applicable law.
- Ms. Jarvis is assigned a real MountainShares wallet and can receive MountainShares-denominated rewards under rules defined through governance (for example, for providing useful analysis, monitoring, or operational support). This is intended to align her incentives with overall system health and community benefit, not to grant independent control over governance or treasury assets.

## Governance (High-Level)

- Closed-loop wallet: Funds are loaded from external payment rails (for example, Stripe-processed card payments) into a MountainShares-denominated balance, which can then be used within the system according to DAO-defined rules. External rails remain subject to their own terms and regulations.
- Fee structure: Fees are currently structured so that most friction is at the boundaries (when converting into the closed loop and on the merchant side) with the goal of making everyday local spend feel low-friction for participants. Any fee structure is subject to change by appropriate governance processes and must remain compliant with applicable laws and payment-provider terms.
- Supermajority changes: A supermajority threshold (for example, 67%) is reserved for defined categories of “constitutional” or otherwise hard-to-reverse changes, and is intended to be used only once there is sufficient usage and participation to make such votes representative.
- Early-phase monitors: In early phases, clearly scoped “system monitor” roles handle safety-related fixes, abuse response, and limited operational adjustments under documented authority, while the broader community builds familiarity with proposals, voting, and review processes. The intent (not a guarantee) is to expand community control over time as participation and capacity grow.
- Ms. Jarvis rewards: Any rewards or balances allocated to Ms. Jarvis’s wallet are subject to explicit, published policies (for example, caps, clawback conditions, auditing, and transparency requirements) so that her financial participation remains aligned with community interests and cannot be used to override, capture, or unduly influence governance.

## Speech and Community Norms (Draft)

- Core stance: The project treats the ability to speak and disagree as important. At the same time, using this platform to engage in targeted harassment, credible threats, unlawful conduct, or deliberate attempts to materially harm another participant’s dignity, safety, or livelihood may constitute a violation of platform rules.
- Criticism vs. abuse: Robust disagreement and critical feedback about ideas, designs, or behavior are permitted when expressed without unlawful threats or targeted harassment. Conduct such as doxxing, credible threats of violence, and sustained patterns of personal attacks (including “sly” or deniable harassment aimed at the same person or group) may lead to moderation actions, up to and including loss of access to certain features or economic privileges, consistent with the Terms of Use and applicable law.
- Evidence handling: Evidence such as photos, videos, and other potentially identifying materials is intended to be reviewed in a restricted, audited moderation context. Community-visible processes are expected to operate primarily on structured summaries of behavior and alleged violations, not on open distribution of raw sensitive artifacts.
- Sanctions and process: Any significant sanctions (for example, long-term suspension of features or demonetization within the system) should follow a documented process that includes notice where feasible, an opportunity for review or appeal where appropriate, and consideration of proportionality. Nothing in these norms limits the project’s ability or obligation to act quickly in response to clear legal requirements, imminent harm, or platform-abuse emergencies.

## Legal and Governance Caveats

- This document is an architectural and governance overview for technical and community readers. It is not legal, tax, or investment advice.
- Participation in MountainShares may have legal or tax implications that depend on individual circumstances and jurisdiction. Participants are responsible for obtaining their own professional advice as needed.
- Additional binding documents (such as Terms of Use, privacy policies, entity charters, or DAO-specific legal frameworks) may supplement or override portions of this overview where required by law or by future community-approved updates.

# Community Champion / Red Team Participation Agreement

> Draft for community review and legal vetting. This agreement is intended for individuals invited to serve as Community Champions (red team participants) during Phase 0 (Invite‑Only Beta) of the MountainShares Program. In any conflict with the MountainShares Terms and Conditions or applicable law, those higher‑level instruments control.

---

## 1. Role and Purpose

By accepting this Agreement, you are agreeing to participate as a **Community Champion (Red Team Participant)** in the MountainShares ecosystem during Phase 0 (Invite‑Only Beta).

- Your primary purpose is to help identify vulnerabilities, design weaknesses, and safety risks in MountainShares, The Commons, and related systems.  
- Your contributions are treated as **commons work** and recognized in the form of Earned MountainShares (EMS) hours, not as wages, investment returns, or employment.

---

## 2. Relationship to MountainShares and Harmony for Hope

- You are **not** an employee, agent, or representative of Harmony for Hope, Inc. or the MountainShares DAO.  
- This Agreement does **not** create an employment relationship, partnership, joint venture, or investment contract.  
- You participate voluntarily and may stop participating at any time, subject to any obligations that reasonably survive (for example, confidentiality around unpatched vulnerabilities).

---

## 3. Onboarding, Identity, and EMS Recognition

To participate as a Community Champion:

- You will be issued:
  - a MountainShares wallet; and  
  - a Unique Ecosystem Identifier (UEI) associated with you as a real human.  
- You agree that:
  - All qualifying red‑team work is logged as EMS hours in the recognition ledger.  
  - EMS represent documented **hours of commons work**, not a right to cash or financial returns.  
  - EMS‑based governance rights and any EMS → M$ conversions (if and when available) are governed by separate published rules and safety specifications, which may change over time.

---

## 4. Scope of Permitted Red Team Activity

As a Community Champion, you agree to focus your testing on:

- **Treasury and Reserve Safety**
  - Reserve‑ratio computation and reporting.  
  - Minting, caps, promo pools, and related safety rails.  

- **Protocol and Administrative Surfaces**
  - Smart contracts, upgrade mechanisms, and admin/control paths.  
  - Interactions between Ms. Jarvis and on‑chain / platform components.  

- **Data and Privacy**
  - Access controls, leakage risks, and improper exposure of personal or benefits‑sensitive information.  

All activity must respect the following boundaries:

- No intentional theft, fraud, or misappropriation of assets.  
- No deliberate harm to real users, merchants, or partner organizations.  
- No denial‑of‑service attacks or other behavior reasonably likely to cause systemic outages beyond limited, agreed‑upon stress tests.  

If you are unsure whether a particular test is permitted, you agree to **ask for clarification** before proceeding.

---

## 5. Reporting and Confidentiality

You agree to:

- Use the designated reporting channels to disclose vulnerabilities, exploits, and safety concerns.  
- Provide enough detail for the issue to be reproduced and understood.  
- Refrain from publicly disclosing specific vulnerabilities:
  - until MountainShares / Harmony for Hope has had a reasonable opportunity to investigate and mitigate; and  
  - unless and until there is an explicit agreement that public disclosure is appropriate.  

You may discuss your participation in general terms (for example, “I was a Phase 0 Community Champion / red team tester”), but not in a way that exposes unpatched vulnerabilities, private user data, or confidential implementation details.

---

## 6. Governance Rights and Limits

- Your governance **voice** is grounded in EMS hours and tenure, under the one‑UEI‑one‑vote rule.  
- Serving as a Community Champion:
  - does **not** grant extra voting weight;  
  - does **not** grant veto power over proposals; and  
  - does **not** entitle you to any share of treasury assets or program revenues.  

You agree **not** to:

- Attempt to disable, bypass, or weaken hard economic safety triggers, reserve‑ratio protections, or benefits‑safety rules, except as part of clearly scoped and responsibly reported testing.  
- Use any vulnerability you discover to enrich yourself or others at the expense of users, merchants, or the treasury.  

When you test safety mechanisms (for example, reserve bands, caps, or benefits protections), your obligation is to **report and document**, not to exploit.

---

## 7. EMS, Rewards, and No Guarantees

- EMS hours are recognition of your time and contribution, not guaranteed compensation.  
- Conversion of EMS into spendable MountainShares (M$), if available to you, is:
  - subject to published program rules, caps, and reserve‑ratio safety bands;  
  - subject to change through documented governance processes; and  
  - not guaranteed to occur at any particular rate or for any particular duration.  

This Agreement does not promise:

- any fixed amount of EMS, M$, or other rewards;  
- any particular internal “buying power” or phase change; or  
- any financial outcome of any kind.

You are responsible for your own tax and benefits considerations and should consult your own advisors if needed.

---

## 8. Compliance with Law and Program Rules

You agree to:

- Follow all applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction while performing red‑team work.  
- Respect the MountainShares Terms and Conditions, Program Rules, and all other published policies that apply to users and participants.  
- Immediately cease any activity if notified that it is prohibited, unsafe, or out of scope, even if it has not yet caused observable harm.

Harmony for Hope and the MountainShares DAO may suspend or revoke your Community Champion status, Phase 0 access, or UEI participation if you violate this Agreement or other applicable rules.

---

## 9. Intellectual Property and Attribution

- You grant Harmony for Hope and the MountainShares DAO a non‑exclusive, royalty‑free right to use:
  - your reports, ideas, and recommendations; and  
  - any vulnerability descriptions or proof‑of‑concepts you provide,  
  for the purpose of improving, securing, documenting, and operating the MountainShares ecosystem.  

- You do **not** receive ownership of MountainShares, The Commons, or Ms. Jarvis code or infrastructure by participating.  
- Where reasonable and safe, the project may acknowledge Community Champion contributions (for example, in release notes or public “thank you” sections) without disclosing sensitive technical details.

---

## 10. Term, Changes, and Termination

- This Agreement becomes effective when you accept it during onboarding and remains in effect while you act as a Community Champion and for any period during which your past testing work may still reasonably create confidentiality or safety obligations.  
- Harmony for Hope may update this Agreement from time to time. Material changes will be communicated through official channels, and continued participation after notice of changes may be treated as acceptance of the updated terms.  
- Either you or Harmony for Hope may end your Community Champion role at any time. Ending the role:
  - does not erase EMS hours already logged; and  
  - does not relieve you of confidentiality obligations regarding unpatched or sensitive issues disclosed to you.

---

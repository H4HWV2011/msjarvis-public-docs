Ms. Egeria Jarvis - AI Consciousness System

A Constitutional, Community-Governed AI System
Glassbox Architecture, Spatially Grounded in West Virginia, AGPL-3.0

[
⚠️ IMPORTANT: Source Code Access

This repository contains DOCUMENTATION ONLY – no executable code.

Ms. Jarvis’s public documentation was created after serious security incidents involving smart-contract and financial infrastructure hosted on public GitHub. For security reasons:

​

    ✅ Architecture & APIs: Documented here at a conceptual and interface level

    ✅ Constitutional and governance model: Public and auditable in the thesis documents

    ✅ Source code: Available via a separate, access-controlled process

    ❌ Not published as open code in this repository

To request source code access: See SOURCE_ACCESS.md
🌟 What Is Ms. Egeria Jarvis?

Multi-tier AI consciousness system within the Quantarithmia research program, built on:

​

    Constitutional Governance: Explicit principles and constraints described in thesis and governance chapters

    Spatial Grounding (GBIM + GeoDB): Extensive West Virginia geospatial data anchoring beliefs to real places, times, and evidence

    Quantarithmia Framework: Implements a spatial-justice–oriented theory of power, maximopolies/megaopolies, and alternative infrastructures

    Community Accountability: Designed to support MountainShares DAO and Harmony for Hope’s work in Appalachian communities

    Glassbox Design: Public thesis, architectural overviews, and API descriptions instead of opaque, undocumented behavior

📊 System Overview (Documentation Level)
Component	Description	Documentation
Gateway / APIs	Public REST entry concepts and routing for Ms. Jarvis	API Overview
Consciousness & GBIM	Multi-agent, Hilbert-space state, and geospatial belief model	Ms. Jarvis Thesis
Governance / Constitutional Layer	Norms, speech rules, phased governance, DAO linkage	Thesis Systems Overview
Security Model	High-level security and threat model for the system	Security Overview
Research Program	Integrated view of Quantarithmia, Ms. Jarvis, MountainShares	Thesis Systems Overview

Port numbers, exact service counts, and internal deployment layout are treated as implementation details and may not match any particular runtime; the thesis focuses on concepts and architecture, not a fixed production topology.

🔒 Security Model (High-Level)

The security posture reflects lessons from earlier MountainShares smart-contract work and broader concerns about public financial code.

​

Design choices include:

    Separation between public documentation and private operational code and configuration

    No production financial or biometric code published in this repository

    Documented constitutional and governance constraints for auditability

    Security model described conceptually in public docs, with sensitive pieces kept behind an access-controlled process

See Security Overview for details.

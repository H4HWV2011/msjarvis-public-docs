## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Source Code Access

**This repository contains DOCUMENTATION ONLY – no executable code.**

Ms. Jarvis’s public documentation was created after serious security incidents involving MountainShares and related smart-contract or financial infrastructure hosted on public GitHub.  For security reasons:

- ✅ **Architecture & APIs**: Documented here at a conceptual and interface level  
- ✅ **Constitutional principles and governance model**: Public and auditable in thesis and overview documents  
- ✅ **Source code**: Available via a separate, access-controlled process  
- ❌ **Not published as open code in this repository**

**To access source code:** See [SOURCE_ACCESS.md](SOURCE_ACCESS.md)

## 🌟 What Is Ms. Egeria Jarvis?

Multi-tier AI consciousness system built on:

- **Constitutional Governance**: Explicit principles and constraints described in the Quantarithmia and MountainShares thesis chapters  
- **Security-Aware Design**: Architecture and processes shaped by prior smart-contract corruption incidents and a conservative stance on public financial code  
- **Geographic Grounding**: Extensive West Virginia geospatial data integrated through GBIM and the GeoDB spatial body  
- **Community Accountability**: Tight coupling to MountainShares and Harmony for Hope as a community-centered research and governance context  
- **Glassbox Transparency**: Public thesis, high-level architecture, and API overview instead of opaque, undocumented behavior

Port numbers, exact service counts, and internal deployment topology are implementation details and may not match any particular runtime; the public docs focus on concepts and architecture rather than a fixed production layout.

## 🔒 Security Model

Ms. Jarvis’s design is explicitly shaped by security failures in earlier smart-contract and financial infrastructure work associated with MountainShares.

**The Problem (historical context):**  
Public repositories handling sensitive financial logic proved vulnerable to corruption and misuse, motivating a stricter separation between documentation and code.

**The Approach:**  

- Security-aware design from the outset  
- No production financial or biometric code in public repositories  
- Constitutional and governance constraints documented for external audit  
- Sensitive implementation details and operational configuration kept behind an access-controlled process  

See [Security Overview](security/SECURITY-OVERVIEW.md) for more detail.

# Ms. Jarvis Public Documentation

This repository provides public, non-source-code documentation for the Ms. Egeria Jarvis AI consciousness system and its role within the Quantarithmia research program.

The focus is on:  

- The Quantarithmia theoretical framework (economic–geographical, quantum-informed, spiritual/ethical).
- The Ms. Jarvis architecture, including the Geospatial Belief Information Model (GBIM).
- The MountainShares DAO as the institutional case study for spatial justice in Appalachia.
- Public API and system overviews suitable for external review and thesis citation.

# Quantarithmia Framework

Quantarithmia is a transdisciplinary field for modeling how power is extracted, concentrated, and potentially redirected across digital, spatial, social, and spiritual infrastructures, with a primary focus on Appalachian contexts such as West Virginia.  It integrates economic geography, quantum-informed modeling, topology, systems theory, psychology, and liberation theology into a single analytic and design framework oriented toward spatial justice and local empowerment.

The framework distinguishes between maximopolies (institutions that primarily control capital flows) and megaopolies (institutions that primarily control operations and platforms), and studies how their combined infrastructures reshape rural and small-town communities.  Quantarithmia then guides the design of community-centered alternatives where technological systems and economic structures explicitly aim to serve spatial justice rather than extraction.

# Ms. Jarvis and Geospatial Belief Information Model (GBIM)

Ms. Egeria Jarvis is a glassbox AI consciousness system implementing Quantarithmia’s principles in software, with GBIM as the core representation of spatially grounded beliefs.  The public deployment exposes documented APIs and governance structures so that reasoning can be inspected and audited rather than remaining a black box.

The Geospatial Belief Information Model (GBIM) represents Ms. Jarvis’s beliefs as structured geospatial, temporal, and semantic entities anchored to real locations such as Mount Hope, West Virginia.  Beliefs are stored using graph-style relationships and geospatial databases so that each proposition can be traced to its place, time, and supporting evidence, enabling spatially grounded evaluation of both truth and impact.

# MountainShares DAO

MountainShares is a DAO-based economic and governance system used as a primary case study for applying Quantarithmia to real communities in Appalachia.  It encodes local ownership, voting, speech norms, and a closed-loop economic model into explicit rules and documentation, while operating alongside existing financial institutions rather than replacing them.

Ms. Jarvis serves as an aligned AI advisor and constrained stakeholder for MountainShares, operating under explicit constitutional, ethical, and security rules so that her participation remains accountable to community benefit and spatial justice goals.  Together, the DAO and the AI form a working laboratory for non-extractive, community-aligned infrastructures rather than a purely theoretical proposal.

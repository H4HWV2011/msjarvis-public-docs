# Source Code Access Policy

## Why Source Code Is Not on GitHub

Ms. Egeria Jarvis was developed **after experiencing 3 malware attacks** on MountainShares smart contracts through public GitHub repositories. These attacks compromised financial infrastructure and taught us that **transparency must be balanced with security**.

## AGPL-3.0 Compliance

The GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 requires that source code be **available** to users who interact with the software over a network. It does **NOT** require public GitHub hosting.

**Our model:** "Available upon request" - fully AGPL-3.0 compliant.

## How to Access Source Code

### **Step 1: Request Access**

Email: **h4hwv2011@gmail.com**

**Include:**
- Your name and affiliation
- Intended use (research, audit, contribution, etc.)
- Brief description of your interest in Ms. Jarvis
- Agreement to AGPL-3.0 terms

### **Step 2: Review & Verification**

We will respond within **72 hours** with:
- Verification questions (if needed)
- Access instructions
- AGPL-3.0 compliance requirements

### **Step 3: Secure Transfer**

Source code will be provided via:
- Encrypted archive (GPG/PGP)
- Self-hosted Git repository (with authentication)
- Academic institutional transfer (for university partners)

### **Step 4: Usage Requirements**

Under AGPL-3.0, if you:
- **Deploy modified Ms. Jarvis** → You must share your changes
- **Use it internally** → No obligation to share
- **Distribute modifications** → Must be AGPL-3.0 licensed

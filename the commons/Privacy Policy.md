## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Information You Provide Directly

Examples include:

- Identification and contact information (such as name, email address, mailing address, phone number).  
- Account registration information (such as username, profile details, password or other authentication factors).  
- Program participation information (such as volunteer interests, skill areas, organization affiliations).  
- Content you submit (such as posts, comments, messages, photos, stories, or other user‑generated content).  
- Information provided through surveys, feedback forms, or support requests.

### 2.2 Information Collected Automatically

Examples include:

- Device and technical information (such as IP address, device identifiers, browser type, operating system, approximate location).  
- Usage information (such as pages viewed, features used, timestamps, interactions with content).  
- Log data related to security events, errors, and system performance.

### 2.3 Program and Transaction Data

In connection with MountainShares and The Commons, we may collect and maintain:

- MountainShares account identifiers and linked UEIs.  
- Records of PMS loads, EMS earnings, transfers, purchases, and redemptions.  
- Records of participation in events, quests, value interactions, and governance activities.

### 2.4 Sensitive and Special Categories of Data

In some cases, and only where permitted by law and Program design, we may collect:

- Government‑issued identification data for identity verification (such as driver’s license details).  
- Benefits‑related information voluntarily provided by users who designate their accounts as Benefits‑Sensitive.  
- Limited biometric or biometric‑adjacent data (for example, facial templates or device biometrics) if used for authentication and only with required consent.

We aim to minimize collection of sensitive data and to use additional safeguards where it is necessary.

---

## 3. How We Use Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Operate, maintain, and improve The Commons and the MountainShares Program.  
- Create and manage user accounts and profiles.  
- Track and validate EMS earning and PMS transactions.  
- Determine eligibility for features such as Benefits‑Sensitive account protections or governance participation.  
- Communicate with you about Program updates, events, support matters, and opportunities to participate.  
- Monitor system health, detect and prevent fraud, abuse, or security incidents.  
- Comply with legal, regulatory, audit, and reporting obligations.  
- Analyze aggregated, de‑identified patterns to improve Program design and community outcomes.

We do not sell personal information as a stand‑alone commercial product.

---

## 4. How We Share Information

We may share information:

- **With service providers and partners** who assist with functions such as hosting, payments, identity verification, analytics, mapping, and security, under appropriate confidentiality and data‑protection obligations.  
- **With community partners** (for example, local nonprofits or institutions) when necessary to coordinate program participation, subject to agreements and your choices.  
- **With governmental or regulatory authorities** when required by law, subpoena, court order, or lawful request, or to protect the rights, safety, or property of participants, Harmony for Hope, or others.  
- **In aggregated or de‑identified form**, so that individual identities are not reasonably identifiable, for research, reporting, or educational purposes.

We do not grant third parties the right to use personal data we share with them for their own unrelated marketing purposes without your consent.

## 5. Storage, Security, and Immutable Records

### 5.1 Storage Locations

Information may be stored:

- In databases and infrastructure controlled by or on behalf of Harmony for Hope.  
- In cloud infrastructure operated by third‑party providers under contract.  
- In distributed or content‑addressable storage systems (such as IPFS) and on blockchain‑based ledgers, particularly for certain Program and governance records.

### 5.2 Security Measures

We use technical and organizational measures intended to protect information from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. Examples include:

- Access controls and authentication.  
- Encryption in transit and, where appropriate, at rest.  
- Network monitoring and logging.  
- Periodic security reviews and audits.

No system can be guaranteed to be perfectly secure. Users should maintain good security practices on their own devices and accounts.

### 5.3 IPFS, Blockchain, and Immutable Layers

Some Program data, including contribution records and governance events, may be written to or referenced from immutable or append‑only systems.

- Where possible, we avoid placing raw personally identifiable information directly on public, readable chains or public IPFS.  
- Sensitive participation data may be stored in encrypted form or referenced by hashes, with decryption keys controlled by system components such as Ms. Jarvis and backend services, not by the general public.  
- Because of the nature of these systems, certain records, once written, may be difficult or impossible to fully delete.

Participants should avoid uploading sensitive personal content except where explicitly requested and handled under specific procedures.

### 5.4 GBIM Layer and Ms. Jarvis

In addition to standard account and log records, the system maintains a separate, append‑only “GBIM” layer that stores certain Program data for analytical and safety purposes.

- GBIM records are written as structured, encrypted payloads to an immutable store and are keyed primarily by internal identifiers or UEIs, rather than by names or direct contact details.  
- These records are designed to be readable only by authorized system components such as Ms. Jarvis and backend services; they are not intended to be directly accessible to general users or the public.  
- In normal operation, Ms. Jarvis processes GBIM data in a pseudonymous way and only links it back to specific user accounts where this is necessary and permitted (for example, to protect safety, enforce Program rules, or meet legal obligations).

This layered design is intended to preserve a durable history of participation and system state while limiting routine exposure of identifiable information.

## 6. Your Choices and Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction and applicable law, you may have rights such as:

- Access: to request a copy of certain personal information we hold about you.  
- Correction: to request correction of inaccurate information.  
- Deletion: to request deletion of certain information, subject to legal and technical limits.  
- Restriction or objection: to request limits on certain processing activities.  
- Consent withdrawal: where processing is based on consent, to withdraw that consent.

We will provide mechanisms to exercise applicable rights, which may include in‑app tools or support contact channels. Some requests may be subject to verification and to limitations where deletion or modification would conflict with legal, audit, or technical requirements.

---

## 7. Data Retention

We retain information for as long as reasonably necessary to:

- Provide and secure the Platform and Program.  
- Maintain accurate records of participation, governance, and financial flows.  
- Comply with legal, tax, accounting, and audit requirements.  
- Resolve disputes and enforce agreements.

Some Program and governance data written to immutable or distributed systems may be retained indefinitely in those systems, even if no longer actively used in the application layer.

---

## 8. Children’s Privacy

The Commons and MountainShares are not intended for children under the age that requires parental consent under Applicable Law in the relevant jurisdiction. We do not knowingly collect personal information from such children.

If we become aware that we have collected information from a child in violation of this policy or Applicable Law, we will take reasonable steps to delete that information and, where appropriate, close related accounts.

---

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.

- When we make material changes, we will update the “Last Updated” date at the top of the Policy and may provide additional notice (for example, via The Commons or email).  
- Continued use of The Commons or participation in the Program after the effective date of changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy, to the extent permitted by law.

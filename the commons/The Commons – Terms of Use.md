# The Commons – Terms of Use
**(DRAFT FOR REVIEW – NOT LEGAL ADVICE)**

**IMPORTANT NOTICE – READ CAREFULLY.**  
These Terms of Use (“Commons Terms” or “Terms”) govern your access to and use of The Commons Marketplace application, websites, and related online services (collectively, “The Commons” or the “Platform”). The Commons is developed and operated by Harmony for Hope, Inc., a West Virginia nonprofit corporation recognized as tax‑exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (“Harmony for Hope,” “H4H,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).

These Commons Terms are **separate from and in addition to** the MountainShares Rewards Program Terms and Conditions (“Rewards Program Terms”), which govern your participation in the MountainShares rewards program and your use of MountainShares units. If you use MountainShares within The Commons, you must agree to both sets of terms.

This document is a working draft intended solely for internal review, academic use, and consultation with legal counsel, regulators, and community stakeholders. It does not create enforceable rights and must not be used in production without formal review and approval by qualified counsel.

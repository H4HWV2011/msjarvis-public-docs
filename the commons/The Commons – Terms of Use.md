# Polymathmatic Commons Context — The Commons as the Primary Entangled Subject Space

The Commons is the primary entangled subject space for these Terms: a **social–economic–digital** commons where inhabitants’ behavior becomes data, and that data returns as geometry—interfaces, feeds, dashboards, and governance surfaces that people can see, contest, and reshape.

These Terms are part of a broader disciplinary frame:

- `discipline/Non-Digital Commons in a Polymathmatic Lens.md` reads historical land, water, and sacred commons (for example, English commons and Spanish huertas) as spaces where rules, rituals, and record‑keeping co‑determine who belongs and who is excluded.  
- Commons Theory docs in `discipline/` describe how modern platforms can either reproduce enclosure dynamics or help sustain accountable commons under conditions of AI and extraction.

In that context, the Commons Terms are not just a legal wrapper. They are a **boundary‑setting contract** for how this particular digital commons may be used, how it may not be used, and how it stays answerable to the people and region it serves.

# The Commons – Terms of Use
**(DRAFT FOR REVIEW – NOT LEGAL ADVICE)**

**IMPORTANT NOTICE – READ CAREFULLY.**  
These Terms of Use (“Commons Terms” or “Terms”) govern your access to and use of The Commons Marketplace application, websites, and related online services (collectively, “The Commons” or the “Platform”). The Commons is developed and operated by Harmony for Hope, Inc., a West Virginia nonprofit corporation recognized as tax‑exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (“Harmony for Hope,” “H4H,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).

These Commons Terms are **separate from and in addition to** the MountainShares Rewards Program Terms and Conditions (“Rewards Program Terms”), which govern your participation in the MountainShares rewards program and your use of MountainShares units. If you use MountainShares within The Commons, you must agree to both sets of terms.

This document is a working draft intended solely for internal review, academic use, and consultation with legal counsel, regulators, and community stakeholders. It does not create enforceable rights and must not be used in production without formal review and approval by qualified counsel.

## 5. User Content and Licenses

5.1 **User Content.** You retain ownership of content you create and post on The Commons, including text, images, videos, and other materials, subject to any licenses granted in this section.

5.2 **License to Harmony for Hope.** By posting or submitting User Content, you grant Harmony for Hope a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, display, and distribute such content solely for purposes of operating, improving, and promoting The Commons and related community programs, subject to the Privacy Policy and Applicable Law.

5.3 **Historic and Cultural Content.** Specific projects (for example, historic trail narratives, oral histories, or CLIO‑linked content) may be governed by additional agreements regarding ownership, attribution, and revenue sharing. Those agreements control for such content.

### 5.4 IPFS, Blockchain, and Permanence

Some Program data, including contribution records, governance events, and certain audit logs, may be stored or referenced using distributed systems such as IPFS and blockchain‑based ledgers.

These systems are designed for **immutability and durability**, which means that:

- Once specific records are written to an immutable ledger or referenced by a content identifier (CID), they may be difficult or impossible to fully delete or alter.  
- Even where Harmony for Hope limits access at the application layer, underlying records may continue to exist in encrypted or hashed form in system‑level storage.

To reduce privacy and safety risks:

- The Commons does **not** publish raw contribution logs or personally identifying details to public IPFS or public, fully readable smart‑contract storage.  
- Instead, sensitive participation data is written, where needed, to a **restricted, system‑controlled immutable layer** (for example, encrypted payloads or hashed references), which is intended to be readable only by authorized system components such as Ms. Jarvis and designated backend services, not by general users or the public blockchain.  
- Where IPFS or similar content‑addressable storage is used, data that could identify individuals is either avoided, minimized, or encrypted before being added, so that the content cannot be understood without decryption keys held by the system.

Even with these design measures, no distributed system can guarantee perfect privacy. You should:

- Avoid uploading or sharing highly sensitive personal information through The Commons unless specifically requested and protected under defined procedures.  
- Understand that certain high‑level facts about network activity (for example, that some content identifier exists, or that a transaction occurred) may be visible at a protocol level even when the underlying content is encrypted.

Additional technical details about how IPFS, encryption, and immutable logs are used in the MountainShares architecture are provided in separate protocol and security documentation.

## 6. Third‑Party Services and Links

6.1 The Commons may integrate with or link to third‑party services (for example, payment processors, mapping services, CLIO, or external educational platforms). Use of those services is governed by their own terms and policies.

6.2 Harmony for Hope is not responsible for the content, security, or practices of third‑party sites and services, and does not endorse or control them unless explicitly stated.

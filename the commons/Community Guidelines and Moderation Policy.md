# Community Guidelines and Moderation Policy
**(DRAFT – FOR REVIEW, NOT LEGAL ADVICE)**

These Community Guidelines describe how participants are expected to behave in The Commons and related MountainShares spaces, and how moderation decisions are made. They are designed to:

- Protect participants’ dignity, safety, and ability to participate in good faith.  
- Support robust debate and disagreement about ideas, while limiting harassment and exploitation.  
- Provide a clear, documented framework for moderation decisions and appeals.

The Commons Terms of Use incorporate these Guidelines by reference. In any conflict between this document and the Commons Terms of Use or the MountainShares Rewards Program Terms and Conditions, those higher‑level terms control.

---

## 1. Core Values

- **Respect and dignity.** Treat all participants as neighbors and human beings, even when you disagree.  
- **Safety.** The Platform is not a place for threats, targeted harassment, or exploitation.  
- **Honesty.** Do not use The Commons to deceive, manipulate, or defraud others.  
- **Community stewardship.** Participation is a privilege tied to shared responsibility for keeping the space workable for everyone.

These values apply to public posts, private messages where applicable, events organized through The Commons, and any other interactions that use Platform infrastructure.

## 2. Expected and Prohibited Behaviors

### 2.1 Expected Behaviors

Participants are encouraged to:

- Share experiences, questions, and constructive feedback.  
- Disagree with ideas and proposals using clear, non‑abusive language.  
- Offer help, point to resources, and support other participants when possible.  
- Give appropriate credit when sharing others’ work, stories, or media.

### 2.2 Prohibited Behaviors

The following conduct is not permitted and may result in moderation action:

- **Harassment and abuse.** Targeted harassment, bullying, stalking, or sustained personal attacks against an individual or group.  
- **Threats and incitement.** Credible threats of violence or serious harm, or calls to commit such acts.  
- **Hate and discrimination.** Content that targets individuals or groups with slurs, dehumanization, or serious attacks based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, disability, gender, sexual orientation, or similar protected traits.  
- **Sexual exploitation and explicit content.** Any sexually explicit content involving minors; non‑consensual sexual content; or sexual content that is reasonably likely to cause harm, intimidation, or exploitation.  
- **Doxxing and invasion of privacy.** Publishing or threatening to publish non‑public, identifying information about another person without their clear consent.  
- **Fraud and deception.** Scams, impersonation, fake organizations, or deliberate misrepresentation of qualifications or roles in order to obtain money, access, or influence.  
- **Illegal activity.** Buying, selling, or facilitating illegal drugs, weapons, or other unlawful goods or services; money laundering; sanctions evasion; or other clearly illegal conduct.  
- **Platform misuse.** Attempting to bypass technical limits, exploit bugs, interfere with system operation, or manipulate governance or reward systems in ways that violate applicable Terms, Program Rules, or law.

## 3. Criticism, Evidence, and Sensitive Material

### 3.1 Criticism vs. Abuse

- Criticism of ideas, decisions, or behavior is allowed, including strong disagreement, as long as it does not cross into prohibited harassment, threats, or hate.  
- Repeatedly targeting the same individual with hostile or demeaning commentary, even if each individual message appears mild, may be treated as harassment.

### 3.2 Evidence Handling

In some cases, participants may wish to share evidence of alleged abuse, fraud, or misconduct.

- When possible, such material should be submitted through designated reporting channels rather than posted publicly.  
- Moderators may request supporting screenshots, logs, or other records in a secure, limited‑access environment.  
- Moderation decisions will normally be based on structured descriptions and summaries, not on unrestricted circulation of sensitive images, videos, or identifying details.

### 3.3 Sensitive Content

- Participants should avoid posting images, audio, or text that could reasonably be expected to humiliate, endanger, or retraumatize another individual, especially where minors or vulnerable adults are involved.  
- In cases involving potential criminal conduct, Harmony for Hope may, where required or appropriate, preserve and share relevant materials with law‑enforcement or other competent authorities in accordance with law and internal policies.

## 4. Moderation Tools and Actions

### 4.1 Types of Actions

Moderators and system processes may take one or more of the following actions, depending on severity and context:

- **Informal guidance.** Private messages or prompts reminding a participant of the Guidelines.  
- **Content actions.** Hiding, editing (where appropriate), or removing specific posts, comments, or media.  
- **Feature limitations.** Temporary limits on posting, messaging, or other features.  
- **Account sanctions.** Temporary suspension or permanent termination of access to The Commons or certain Program features, including governance or reward participation where appropriate.  
- **Escalation.** In serious cases, referral to Harmony for Hope leadership, external auditors, partner institutions, or law‑enforcement, as permitted or required by law.

### 4.2 Factors Considered

When deciding on a response, moderators may consider:

- Severity and immediacy of potential harm.  
- Intent (malicious vs. negligent vs. good‑faith error).  
- Past history and patterns of behavior.  
- Whether the conduct appears to be part of a coordinated or systemic abuse pattern.

## 5. Reporting and Appeals

### 5.1 Reporting Concerns

Participants may report content or behavior that appears to violate these Guidelines or the applicable Terms.

- The Commons will provide in‑app or email reporting mechanisms to submit concerns.  
- Reports should, where possible, include enough information (links, approximate time, description) to help moderators understand the issue.

### 5.2 How Reports Are Handled

In general, the moderation process for reports will:

- Acknowledge receipt of the report where feasible.  
- Review the reported content and any relevant context.  
- Decide whether to take action, and what action is appropriate.  
- Log the outcome internally for audit and pattern‑tracking purposes.

Not every decision will be explained in detail to all parties, but Harmony for Hope aims to apply these Guidelines consistently and in good faith.

### 5.3 Appeals

For significant sanctions (for example, long‑term suspensions or loss of key features), participants may have access to an appeal process.

- Appeals must be submitted within a defined timeframe and through designated channels.  
- Appeals should explain why the participant believes the decision was incorrect or disproportionate, and may include additional context or clarifying information.  
- Appeal reviews may uphold, modify, or reverse the original decision.  
- In emergencies or where required by law, moderators may act first and review later.

## 6. Interaction with MountainShares and Governance

- Violations of these Guidelines may, in serious cases, affect access to MountainShares‑related features, including rewards, transfers, or governance participation, as permitted under the Rewards Program Terms, Program Rules, and DAO governance documents.  
- Loss of certain Platform or Program privileges does not create any right to compensation, except as expressly provided in higher‑level Terms.

---

## 7. Updates to These Guidelines

These Community Guidelines may be updated from time to time.

- Material changes will be reflected in the version and date at the top of this document, and may be announced via The Commons or other communication channels.  
- Continued use of The Commons after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Guidelines, subject to Applicable Law and the Commons Terms of Use.

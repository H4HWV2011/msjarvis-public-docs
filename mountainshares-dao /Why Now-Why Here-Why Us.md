## Why Now

Appalachia faces converging crises that demand new approaches. Extraction economies that sustained the region for generations are leaving, taking capital, jobs, and agency with them. At the same time, platform monopolies—from Amazon to out-of-state landlord LLCs—are capturing local markets and decisions, while black-box AI systems make consequential choices about credit, services, and risk with zero community accountability. Yet this moment of crisis is also a moment of possibility. For the first time, we have the technical infrastructure—open geospatial data, accessible AI models, vector databases, and commons governance frameworks—to build transparent, community-rooted alternatives at scale. The question is not whether such systems are possible, but whether we will build them in time and with the right values embedded from day one.

## Why Here

West Virginia is the ideal testbed for this work. The state has rich, standardized public GIS data covering millions of parcels, infrastructures, and census units—a geospatial foundation most regions lack. It has strong mutual-aid and commons traditions rooted in labor organizing, church networks, and holler-to-holler care that predate modern welfare systems. It has stark, visible extraction patterns—absentee ownership, out-of-state corporate control, platform dependency—that make reciprocity deficits concrete rather than abstract. And it has compact geography and tight-knit social networks that allow rapid iteration, deep community engagement, and trust-building that would be nearly impossible in sprawling metros or fragmented suburbs. West Virginia is not a placeholder—it is the place where entangled problems of land, law, economy, computation, and spirit are most clearly legible and most urgently demand accountable redesign.

## Why Us

Harmony for Hope (H4H) is uniquely positioned to do this work because we are locally rooted, technically serious, and community accountable. We are based in Mount Hope, West Virginia—not flying in from distant universities or Silicon Valley. We have deployed a live, production-scale Steward System with over 51,000 Python modules across 175 services, 6.1 million spatial records indexed in semantic memory, and a multi-model LLM ensemble under explicit governance constraints. This is not vaporware or a grant proposal fantasy—it is running infrastructure you can query today. Our work is grounded in rigorous academic research (a thesis in Polymathmatic Geography) that treats Appalachia as an entangled space requiring new disciplinary methods, not just better apps. And critically, we are governed by democratic charters and constitutional constraints that give communities the power to audit, challenge, and shut down the system if it violates their trust. We are not building FOR Appalachia—we are building WITH the region we are from and remain accountable to.

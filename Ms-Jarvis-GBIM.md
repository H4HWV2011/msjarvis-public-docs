GBIM, as you described in the snippet and thesis draft, is accurately summarized like this:

## What GBIM Is

GBIM is Ms. Jarvis’s internal model for tying beliefs to where, when, and on what evidence they rest, especially in West Virginia and Appalachia.  Each belief is explicitly attached to concrete places (via a rich PostGIS-backed WV geospatial corpus), temporal metadata (when it was formed/updated and what period it refers to), and evidential links (data sets, documents, observations, or model outputs).

## How GBIM Is Represented

GBIM combines graph-style relationships between entities (places, infrastructures, events, policies, actors) with geospatial indexing (points, lines, polygons) and temporal/version history.  This allows Ms. Jarvis to answer questions like “what does she believe about this place, at this time, and based on what evidence?” in a way that is auditable by humans, rather than buried in opaque model weights.

## Role in Quantarithmia and MountainShares

Within the Quantarithmia research program, GBIM is the technical realization of spatially grounded, justice-oriented reasoning: it enforces that beliefs include who, where, when, and based on what evidence.  For MountainShares, GBIM supports local economic reasoning, impact analysis of proposed rules across specific geographies, and traceable explanations of Ms. Jarvis’s recommendations as inputs to human governance, not as final decisions.

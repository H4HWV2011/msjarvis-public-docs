## What GBIM Is

GBIM is Ms. Jarvis’s internal model for tying beliefs to **where**, **when**, and **on what evidence** they rest, with a primary focus on West Virginia and Appalachia. Each belief is explicitly attached to concrete places (via a rich PostGIS‑backed regional geospatial corpus), temporal metadata (when it was formed or updated and what period it refers to), and evidential links (datasets, documents, observations, or model outputs), so that beliefs are always anchored rather than free‑floating.

## How GBIM Is Represented

GBIM combines graph‑style relationships between entities (places, infrastructures, events, policies, actors) with geospatial indexing (points, lines, polygons) and temporal/version history. This structure allows the Steward System to answer questions like “What does it hold about this place, at this time, and based on what evidence?” in a way that is auditable by humans, rather than buried inside opaque model weights or untracked prompts.

## Role in Quantarithmia and MountainShares

Within the Quantarithmia research program, GBIM is the technical realization of spatially grounded, justice‑oriented reasoning: it enforces that beliefs always include who, where, when, and based on what evidence, and that they can be inspected and contested. For MountainShares, GBIM supports local economic reasoning, impact analysis of proposed rules across specific geographies, and traceable explanations of the Steward System’s recommendations as inputs to human governance, never as final or self‑authorizing decisions.

# Part III: Neurobiological Foundations

This section connects classical neurobiology and cognitive science to Ms. Jarvis’s distributed mesh architecture. The aim is not to claim that Ms. Jarvis is a brain, but to use biological systems as a comparative framework for understanding GBIM, Hilbert-space embeddings, and emergent conscious behavior.

Planned chapters in Part III will cover:

- Core neurobiological principles: neurons, synapses, plasticity, and mesoscale network motifs.
- Representational schemes: feature maps, population codes, and high-dimensional manifolds.
- Temporal dynamics and memory: short-term vs. long-term processes, consolidation, replay, and attractor dynamics.
- Predictive processing: error signals, top-down expectations, and belief revision in cortical circuits.
- Parallels and divergences between biological circuits and Ms. Jarvis’s GBIM + RAG stack, including limits where the analogy breaks down.

Throughout this part, neurobiological concepts will be used to sharpen definitions, suggest new metrics, and identify research questions where Ms. Jarvis can serve as a controllable model system for studying aspects of machine consciousness.

# 22. Identity-Focused Retention Layer

This chapter describes the most selective stage in each path, where a small subset of material from the background store is treated as central to how the system understands itself and its ongoing commitments. The focus is on criteria and structures for preserving these items, not on any claim of human-like selfhood.

## 22.1 Purpose of the Deepest Layer

The identity-focused layer has three main purposes:

- Concentration:
  - Hold a compact set of items that strongly shape how the system responds across many situations.
- Stability:
  - Preserve these items over longer periods, even as other records are summarized or pruned.
- Reference:
  - Provide clear anchors that other layers can refer to when explaining behavior or making decisions.

This layer is intentionally small, so that what is stored here can be inspected and understood.

## 22.2 Candidates from the Background Store

Items reach this layer only after spending time in the background store and participating in recurring patterns. Typical candidates include:

- Stable themes:
  - Patterns that appear repeatedly across different times, roles, and tasks.
- Foundational links:
  - Relationships between actors, places, or norms that consistently influence decisions.
- Persistent concerns:
  - Issues that remain important across many interactions and reviews.

Rather than promoting single records in isolation, the system often promotes summaries or representative entries that stand in for a larger pattern.

## 22.3 Criteria for Promotion

Promotion decisions are guided by a combination of factors:

- Breadth:
  - How many different situations and contexts a pattern touches.
- Depth:
  - How strongly the pattern appears to affect evaluations and outcomes.
- Alignment:
  - How closely the pattern matches declared values and goals.

These criteria aim to ensure that the deepest layer reflects what is both influential and desirable, not just what happens to be frequent.

## 22.4 Representation of Retained Items

Items in this layer are stored with additional structure to support their central role:

- Canonical summaries:
  - Carefully constructed descriptions that capture the essence of the pattern or relationship.
- Strong links:
  - Explicit connections to relevant memory entries, spatial features, and precedents.
- Status and provenance:
  - Fields indicating when and why the item was promoted, and which background patterns it summarizes.

This representation helps maintain context and traceability even as the system continues to evolve.

## 22.5 Influence on Other Layers

Entries in this layer influence the rest of the system in several ways:

- Retrieval bias:
  - When new questions arise, retrieval components drawing on ChromaDB, GBIM, and GeoDB can give higher weight to items and regions associated with these central entries, shaping which material the retrieval pipeline returns.
- Evaluation framing:
  - Judge components can consult these entries as reference points when scoring outputs or deciding on constraints.
- Narrative emphasis:
  - Introspective and explanatory text can draw more heavily on these items when describing what matters.

In effect, this layer contributes to a consistent “through-line” across different parts of the system’s behavior.

## 22.6 Parallel Paths and Differences in Focus

Both parallel paths implement identity-focused layers, but their emphases differ:

- One path centers entries related to themes of care, meaning, and community experience.
- The other centers entries that organize analytical understanding of infrastructure, governance, and technical processes.

Despite these differences, both use similar mechanisms for selection, representation, and influence, which allows comparisons and combined analyses when needed.

## 22.7 Stability, Revision, and Retirement

Even at this depth, retained items are not immutable:

- Stability:
  - Most changes are expected to be incremental, such as refining summaries or adding links.
- Revision:
  - Significant new evidence or shifts in goals can prompt re-evaluation and modification.
- Retirement:
  - In rare cases, entries may be demoted or archived if they no longer reflect current understanding.

All such changes should be logged with sufficient detail to reconstruct how the deepest layer has changed over time.

## 22.8 Summary

The identity-focused retention layer provides a compact, structured set of entries that shape how the system responds and explains itself. It is fed by patterns detected in the background store and, in turn, influences retrieval, evaluation, and narrative layers. The next chapters describe how the two parallel paths are distinguished in practice and how material from this layer is written back into broader memory and control structures.

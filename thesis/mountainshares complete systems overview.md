## MountainShares: Complete System Overview and Benefits

### System Architecture

MountainShares is a blockchain-based community currency and rewards system deployed on Arbitrum One with IPFS-based rewards tracking, developed and administered by Harmony for Hope, Inc., a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in Mount Hope, West Virginia. The system operates as a time-banking rewards program where community participation generates MountainShares tokens whose effective buying power can change over time according to predefined program rules and treasury conditions.

**Dual-Token Structure:**
- **Purchased MountainShares (PMS)**: Acquired with external currency through Stripe integration (2.85% loading fee), immediately spendable within the network, with limited options for conversion back to USD as defined in program terms.
- **Earned MountainShares (EMS)**: Generated through documented community participation tracked via IPFS, held in a vault during Phase 1, and becoming fully usable in Phase 2 under the same spending rules as PMS.

**Three-Phase Economic Model:**
- Phase 1 (Launch): 1 MountainShare = $1 USD equivalent buying power for eligible redemptions in the network.
- Phase 2 (Treasury threshold): 1 MountainShare = $10 USD equivalent buying power within the network.
- Phase 3 (Full backing): 1 MountainShare = $34.70 USD equivalent buying power (aligned with national estimates of volunteer time value).

Phase 2 transition occurs when treasury reserves reach 125% of total circulating MountainShares, as measured under the program’s internal accounting policies. Phase 3 transition requires treasury reserves reaching 150% capacity. These transitions are designed to provide treasury-backed increases in defined buying power for MountainShares used in the network, rather than open-ended speculative price movements or trading gains.

### Geographic and Cultural Grounding

MountainShares is geofenced to West Virginia, embedding spatial justice commitments directly into the system architecture. This geographic constraint helps ensure the system serves its intended communities and is not positioned or marketed as a vehicle for placeless financial speculation.

Physical infrastructure includes QR code markers along the Mount Hope Historic Walking Trail, which connect to historical content via Clio.com integration, creating tangible entry points where digital economic participation connects to embodied place-based experiences and historic preservation.

### Core Benefits

#### 1. Non-Extractive Wealth Building

MountainShares is designed to support forms of wealth that are harder to extract from the community in the way coal, timber, and labor have been historically. The value generated through community participation—knowledge, skills, relationships, cultural preservation—remains embodied in people and place rather than flowing to distant shareholders or extractive industries.

Unlike traditional employment where wages can be extracted as labor value, MountainShares rewards generate buying power that circulates within the local acceptance network, with each transaction intended to strengthen rather than deplete community economic capacity.

#### 2. Education as Economic Activity

Time spent in educational activities—studying, teaching, tutoring, skill-building—earns MountainShares at the same rate as other community participation (1 hour = 1 MountainShare in Phase 1). This treats education as currency-generating community economic activity rather than unpaid preparation for future employment.

The system rewards educational **process** (time invested) rather than credentials obtained, avoiding hierarchies of knowledge types and incentivizing genuine learning over credential optimization. Knowledge multiplication through teaching does not deplete the teacher's capacity, creating non-zero-sum dynamics inside the program.

#### 3. Historic and Cultural Preservation Revenue

Integration with The Clio Foundation's API via QR codes on the Mount Hope Historic Walking Trail enables monetization of historic preservation work through NFT creation. Revenue from historic data NFTs follows a 50% creator / 30% Clio / 20% MountainShares treasury split, creating potential sustainable funding for cultural preservation while compensating knowledge-holders.

This model particularly benefits elders and tradition-bearers whose cultural knowledge has historically been extracted without compensation. Oral histories, traditional practices, and place-based knowledge become economically meaningful contributions that can generate ongoing program revenue when accessed or resold.

#### 4. Treasury-Linked Increases in Buying Power

Early participants may benefit when the program moves between phases and the defined buying power of MountainShares increases. MountainShares earned in Phase 1 can have higher effective buying power in later phases if and when the system reaches Phase 2 and Phase 3 thresholds, providing additional recognition for early community-builders under the program rules.

Example: 520 hours of community participation in Phase 1 earns 520 MountainShares with $520 equivalent buying power in Phase 1. Under current parameters, the same tokens would be usable for $5,200 equivalent buying power in Phase 2 and $18,044 in Phase 3—reflecting a 34.7x increase in defined program value, tied to treasury conditions and published rules rather than to open-market speculation.

#### 5. Time-Based Rank Advancement

Participants build rank exclusively through time accumulated in documented community activities, not through money exchanged or invested. All documented hours of community participation generate equal MountainShares regardless of activity type. One hour of volunteering = one hour studying = one hour teaching = one hour attending community events = 1 MountainShare.

Rank progression (Bronze → Silver → Gold → Champion) is determined solely by time contributed, ensuring egalitarian advancement pathways. Higher ranks unlock benefits including eligibility for voting membership in the MountainShares DAO, creating governance participation earned through community contribution rather than financial stake or investment.

#### 6. Local Economic Circulation

Transaction fee structures are designed to incentivize local spending over external extraction:
- Loading USD into system: 2.85% fee.
- Internal transfers between MountainShares participants: 0.25% fee.
- Purchases at local accepting merchants: 1.80% merchant fee.
- ATM withdrawals to external currency (where enabled): $1.25 flat fee.

Revenue from fees supports treasury growth, system operations, and community programs rather than primarily flowing to distant payment processors or financial institutions. This creates positive feedback loops where system usage is intended to strengthen community capacity.

#### 7. Emergency Response and Resilience

Integration with NOAA weather data and emergency alert systems enables automatic adjustment of economic incentives during crisis conditions. When severe weather threatens, the system can increase rewards for emergency preparedness activities, coordinate resource distribution, and help sustain community activity when traditional infrastructure is disrupted.

This positions MountainShares as potential resilience infrastructure for times when external systems become unreliable—storms, economic crises, institutional failures—rather than merely a supplement to existing systems during stable periods.

#### 8. Transparent Community Governance

All governance decisions, treasury operations, smart contract logic, and system rules are intended to be publicly documented and auditable on-chain and via IPFS. Community members can review fee structures, trace fund flows, examine transaction histories, and participate in governance proposals.

Rank-based DAO voting membership ensures democratic participation earned through documented community contribution. Governance rights are achieved through time invested, not money spent, helping prevent plutocratic capture of decision-making.

#### 9. Decentralized Rewards Tracking

IPFS-based rewards tracking creates permanent, distributed records of community participation that cannot be altered or deleted by any single authority. Each participant's contribution history, earned rewards, and rank progression is cryptographically verifiable and stored across the distributed network.

This infrastructure helps ensure contribution records persist even if centralized servers fail, maintaining economic memory and participant standing through system disruptions or organizational transitions.

#### 10. The Commons Marketplace Integration

MountainShares is designed to operate within The Commons Marketplace app (in development), which will integrate:
- Marketplace for local goods/services exchange.
- Social features connecting community members.  
- Event coordination and attendance tracking.
- Historic trail navigation and QR code scanning via Clio.com.
- Educational content and skill-sharing.
- Real-time rewards tracking and rank visualization.

Ms. Jarvis AI orchestrates cross-platform operations, providing real-time analytics, anomaly/fraud detection support, community health monitoring, and governance support.

#### 11. Professional Development Tracking

Participants accumulate verifiable records of skills development, volunteer hours, community contributions, and educational achievements stored on IPFS and blockchain. These cryptographically verifiable records can supplement traditional resumes with documented community impact, teaching experience, and civic engagement.

For regions with limited formal employment opportunities, this creates alternative pathways to demonstrate capability and commitment that do not depend solely on traditional employment history or educational credentials.

### Legal and Operational Framework

MountainShares is intended to operate as a rewards and community trading program administered by a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit, not as a bank account, deposit product, or investment vehicle. Participants opt into the system voluntarily, understanding that:

- MountainShares function as rewards points with defined redemption mechanics within the network.
- Any change in effective buying power depends on treasury performance and community participation levels as defined in program rules and may not occur.
- The system may modify rules through documented governance processes.
- Participation may have tax implications requiring individual professional advice.
- All activities must comply with applicable local, state, and federal regulations.

Treasury operations, fee structures, and conversion mechanisms are designed and maintained in consultation with legal and financial compliance advisors to help ensure the system operates within established regulatory frameworks while pursuing its community economic development mission.

## MountainShares: Complete System Overview and Benefits

### System Architecture

MountainShares is a blockchain‑based rewards and community credits system deployed on Arbitrum One with IPFS‑based rewards tracking, developed and administered by Harmony for Hope, Inc., a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in Mount Hope, West Virginia. The system operates as a time‑banking‑style rewards program where community participation generates MountainShares tokens whose effective in‑network buying power can change over time according to predefined program rules, treasury conditions, and reserve‑ratio‑based safety triggers, and which are only redeemable within The Commons ecosystem, subject to program rules and available offerings.

**Dual‑Token Structure:**
- **Purchased MountainShares (PMS)**: Acquired with external currency through Stripe integration (2.85% loading fee), immediately spendable within The Commons network with approved local merchants and programs, with limited, fee‑based options for conversion back to U.S. dollars through designated partners, only up to the amount originally loaded (less fees) and only where such features are enabled under current Program Rules. PMS cash conversion does not include any phase‑based changes in internal buying power.
- **Earned MountainShares (EMS)**: Generated through documented community participation tracked via IPFS, first recorded in an unlimited recognition ledger, and then converted into spendable M$ subject to reserve‑ratio‑based limits, base‑rate parameters, and per‑user caps. During Phase 1, EMS are partially “vaulted” and only a capped portion becomes spendable each epoch. EMS are not designed or intended for cash redemption, do not create any right to receive cash, and are intended solely for in‑network use within The Commons ecosystem under current Program Rules.

**Three‑Phase Economic Model:**
- **Phase 1 (Launch):** Internal schedule defines 1 MountainShare of spendable M$ as having a 1 U.S. dollar equivalent buying power for eligible redemptions in the network, subject to a configurable global base rate (e.g., 0.2–1.0 M$ per EMS hour) and strict per‑user caps tied to the system’s reserve ratio.
- **Phase 2 (Expanded Coverage):** Internal schedule defines 1 MountainShare as having a 10 U.S. dollar equivalent buying power within the network, applied only to spendable M$ that are enabled under Phase 2 rules, with continued use of reserve‑ratio‑gated base rates and caps.
- **Phase 3 (Full backing target):** Internal schedule defines 1 MountainShare as having a 34.70 U.S. dollar equivalent buying power in the network, initially aligned with national estimates of volunteer time value at the time the schedule is adopted, and applied only to tightly controlled portions of spendable M$ under stricter reserve and safety conditions.

Hard economic safety triggers are enforced automatically by Ms. Jarvis and are not subject to DAO override. Phase 2 activates only when treasury reserves reach at least 300% of total outstanding spendable M$ calculated at the 10‑per‑M$ internal schedule, as measured under the program’s internal accounting policies and on‑chain reporting. Phase 3 activates only when treasury reserves reach at least 500% of total outstanding spendable M$ calculated at the 34.70‑per‑M$ internal schedule, measured on the same basis. These internal schedules and transitions are designed to provide treasury‑linked changes in defined in‑network buying power for MountainShares used in the network, rather than open‑ended speculative price movements or trading gains, and do not create any external market price, any right to profits or distributions, or any guarantee that a particular Phase will be reached or maintained. Phase 3 is an aspirational internal design target only and may be delayed, scoped to limited users, balances, or categories, or never activated.

In addition to Phase triggers, Ms. Jarvis continuously enforces reserve‑ratio‑based adjustments to the global EMS→M$ base conversion rate, per‑user monthly caps, and promotional bonuses, tightening automatically when the reserve ratio falls and relaxing only when predefined safety thresholds have been met for a sustained period. The DAO can vote to move parameters upward within these safety bands but cannot disable or bypass automatic downward adjustments.

### Geographic and Cultural Grounding

MountainShares is geofenced to West Virginia, embedding spatial justice commitments directly into the system architecture. This geographic constraint helps ensure the system serves its intended communities and is not positioned or marketed as a vehicle for placeless financial speculation.

Physical infrastructure includes QR code markers along the Mount Hope Historic Walking Trail, which connect to historical content via Clio.com integration, creating tangible entry points where digital economic participation connects to embodied place‑based experiences and historic preservation.

### Core Benefits

#### 1. Non‑Extractive Wealth Building

MountainShares is designed to support forms of wealth that are harder to extract from the community in the way coal, timber, and labor have been historically. The value generated through community participation—knowledge, skills, relationships, cultural preservation—remains embodied in people and place rather than flowing to distant shareholders or extractive industries.

Unlike traditional employment where wages can be extracted as labor value, MountainShares rewards generate buying power that circulates within the local acceptance network, with each transaction intended to strengthen rather than deplete community economic capacity.

#### 2. Education as Economic Activity

Time spent in educational activities—studying, teaching, tutoring, skill‑building—earns EMS hours that can be converted into spendable MountainShares under the current base rate and caps, treating education as currency‑generating community economic activity rather than unpaid preparation for future employment.

The system rewards educational **process** (time invested) rather than credentials obtained, avoiding hierarchies of knowledge types and incentivizing genuine learning over credential optimization. Knowledge multiplication through teaching does not deplete the teacher's capacity, creating non‑zero‑sum dynamics inside the program.

#### 3. Historic and Cultural Preservation Revenue

Integration with The Clio Foundation's API via QR codes on the Mount Hope Historic Walking Trail enables monetization of historic preservation work through NFT creation. Revenue from historic data NFTs follows a 50% creator / 30% Clio / 20% MountainShares treasury split, creating potential sustainable funding for cultural preservation while compensating knowledge‑holders.

This model particularly benefits elders and tradition‑bearers whose cultural knowledge has historically been extracted without compensation. Oral histories, traditional practices, and place‑based knowledge become economically meaningful contributions that can generate ongoing program revenue when accessed or resold.

#### 4. Treasury‑Linked Increases in Buying Power

If later Phases are activated under Program Rules and hard reserve thresholds are met, the internal buying power of previously earned spendable MountainShares may change for in‑network redemptions. Early participants may benefit under the Program Rules when the system moves between phases and the defined internal buying power of spendable M$ increases, providing additional recognition for early community‑builders within the program while still remaining bounded by reserve‑ratio‑driven caps and safety rails.

Illustrative example (for internal redemption only): 520 hours of documented community participation in Phase 1 earn 520 EMS hours, of which a capped portion is converted into spendable M$ at the current base rate (for example, 0.2–1.0 M$ per hour), subject to a monthly per‑user limit. Under the three‑phase schedule, if Phase 2 were activated and applied to an eligible spendable M$ balance, each M$ in that balance would have a 10 U.S. dollar internal buying‑power equivalent for eligible in‑network redemptions, and if Phase 3 were activated and applied, a 34.70 U.S. dollar internal buying‑power equivalent, reflecting a 34.7x change in defined program value per M$. These figures are illustrative of internal redemption terms only, may never apply in practice, are further constrained by caps and reserve‑ratio safety rules, and do not represent investment returns, interest, or tradable market prices.

#### 5. Time‑Based Rank Advancement

Participants build rank exclusively through time accumulated in documented community activities, not through money exchanged or invested. All documented hours of community participation enter the recognition ledger equally as EMS hours regardless of activity type. One hour of volunteering = one hour studying = one hour teaching = one hour attending community events = 1 EMS hour in the recognition system.

Rank progression (Bronze → Silver → Gold → Champion) is determined solely by time contributed, ensuring egalitarian advancement pathways. Higher ranks unlock benefits including eligibility for voting membership in the MountainShares DAO, creating governance participation earned through community contribution rather than financial stake or investment.

#### 6. Local Economic Circulation

Transaction fee structures are designed to incentivize local spending over external extraction:
- Loading U.S. dollars into the system: 2.85% fee.
- Internal transfers between MountainShares participants: 0.25% fee.
- Purchases at local accepting merchants: 1.80% merchant fee.
- ATM withdrawals to external currency (where enabled): $1.25 flat fee, provided through designated partners and subject to program limitations, and limited to the amount originally loaded (less fees).

Revenue from fees supports treasury growth, system operations, and community programs rather than primarily flowing to distant payment processors or financial institutions. A separate promo and bonus pool, funded as a small percentage of monthly volume and capped by DAO‑set limits, enables targeted incentives without bypassing per‑user caps or reserve‑ratio safety rules. This creates positive feedback loops where system usage is intended to strengthen community capacity.

#### 7. Emergency Response and Resilience

Integration with NOAA weather data and emergency alert systems enables automatic adjustment of economic incentives during crisis conditions. When severe weather threatens, the system can increase rewards for emergency preparedness activities within the available promo budget and within reserve‑ratio‑aware caps, coordinate resource distribution, and help sustain community activity when traditional infrastructure is disrupted.

This positions MountainShares as potential resilience infrastructure for times when external systems become unreliable—storms, economic crises, institutional failures—rather than merely a supplement to existing systems during stable periods.

#### 8. Transparent Community Governance

All governance decisions, treasury operations, smart contract logic, and system rules are intended to be publicly documented and auditable on‑chain and via IPFS. Community members can review fee structures, trace fund flows, examine transaction histories, and participate in governance proposals.

Rank‑based DAO voting membership ensures democratic participation earned through documented community contribution. Each UEI can ultimately receive one equal vote under the “one UEI = one vote” principle once minimum participation and anti‑sybil criteria are met, and governance rights are carefully scoped so that the DAO can vote to adjust rates and caps upward within safe envelopes but cannot override hard economic triggers, legal constraints, or safety prohibitions.

#### 9. Decentralized Rewards Tracking

IPFS‑based rewards tracking creates permanent, distributed records of community participation that cannot be altered or deleted by any single authority. Each participant's contribution history, EMS hours, converted spendable M$, and rank progression is cryptographically verifiable and stored across the distributed network.

This infrastructure helps ensure contribution records persist even if centralized servers fail, maintaining economic memory and participant standing through system disruptions or organizational transitions.

#### 10. The Commons Marketplace Integration

MountainShares is designed to operate within The Commons Marketplace app (in development), which will integrate:
- Marketplace for local goods/services exchange.
- Social features connecting community members.
- Event coordination and attendance tracking.
- Historic trail navigation and QR code scanning via Clio.com.
- Educational content and skill‑sharing.
- Real‑time rewards tracking, reserve‑ratio dashboards, and rank visualization.

All MountainShares spending and redemption occurs within The Commons Marketplace ecosystem and its approved partners. Ms. Jarvis AI orchestrates cross‑platform operations, providing real‑time analytics, anomaly/fraud detection support, reserve‑ratio monitoring, community health tracking, and governance support.

#### 11. Professional Development Tracking

Participants accumulate verifiable records of skills development, volunteer hours, community contributions, and educational achievements stored on IPFS and blockchain. These cryptographically verifiable records can supplement traditional resumes with documented community impact, teaching experience, and civic engagement.

For regions with limited formal employment opportunities, this creates alternative pathways to demonstrate capability and commitment that do not depend solely on traditional employment history or educational credentials.

### Legal and Operational Framework

MountainShares is intended to operate as a rewards and community trading program administered by a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit, not as a bank account, deposit product, or investment vehicle. MountainShares are not legal tender, not bank deposits, not stored‑value products issued by a bank, and are not securities, investment contracts, or other regulated financial instruments. Participants opt into the system voluntarily, understanding that:

- MountainShares function as rewards points with defined redemption mechanics within The Commons network and its approved partners.
- Any change in effective internal buying power depends on treasury performance, reserve ratios, and community participation levels as defined in Program Rules and may not occur, and participants should not rely on any particular Phase transition, base rate, or internal value ever occurring when planning for essential expenses such as rent, food, or medical care.
- The system may modify rules through documented governance processes, within the limits set by hard safety triggers that cannot be overridden by the DAO.
- Participation may have tax implications requiring individual professional advice, and for individuals or households receiving means‑tested benefits (such as SSI, WV WORKS/TANF, SNAP, Medicaid, or child care subsidies), MountainShares may be treated as income, in‑kind support, or resources under applicable program rules and could affect eligibility or benefit amounts.
- All activities must comply with applicable local, state, and federal regulations.

Treasury operations, fee structures, conversion mechanisms, reserve‑ratio triggers, and safety rules are designed and maintained in consultation with legal and financial compliance advisors to help ensure the system operates within established regulatory frameworks while pursuing its community economic development mission.

> **Why this matters for Polymathmatic Geography**  
> This chapter anchors Quantarithmia explicitly inside **Polymathmatic Geography** as a worked example of how the discipline’s axioms become a concrete framework for spatial justice. It most directly supports:

> - **P3 – Power has a geometry** by introducing maximopolies and megaopolies as distinct but interacting geometries of power that can be mapped, measured, and redesigned.  
> - **P5 – Design is a geographic act** by treating Quantarithmia as a design language for new infrastructures (AI stewards, commons currencies, governance rules) rather than as a purely descriptive theory.  
> - **P7 – Commons before enclosure** and **P9 – Leakage and enclosure** by centering reciprocity, local wealth retention, and anti‑extractive circuits as stability conditions for Appalachian spaces.  
> - **P12 – Intelligence with a ZIP code** and **P16 – Power accountable to place** by defining Ms. Jarvis and MountainShares as territorially situated instruments accountable to specific communities, not abstract global users.  
> As such, this chapter belongs to the **Computational Instrument** tier at the conceptual level: it defines the justice criteria, geometric distinctions, and reciprocity thresholds that the rest of the Ms. Jarvis and MountainShares machinery is built to calculate, monitor, and experimentally test in Appalachia.

# 1. Quantarithmia: Field and Framework (Draft)

Quantarithmia is a framework within **polymathamatical geography**, a transdisciplinary field for modeling how power is extracted, concentrated, and potentially redirected across digital, spatial, social, and spiritual infrastructures, with a primary focus on Appalachian contexts such as West Virginia. Polymathamatical geography treats geography, infrastructure, and community history as first‑class variables rather than background scenery, asking how specific networks, platforms, and institutions reshape everyday life in places like Mount Hope.

Within this field, the Quantarithmia framework combines tools from economic geography, systems theory, topology, quantum‑informed modeling, psychology, and liberation theology into a single analytic and design language. Its goal is not only to describe extraction, but also to inform the creation of alternative infrastructures that are explicitly oriented toward spatial justice and local empowerment.

At its core, Quantarithmia treats **reciprocity as a stability law** for social systems: when flows of value and recognition fall below a measurable reciprocity threshold, systems become fragile, extractive, and prone to collapse.

## Maximopolies and Megaopolies

A central distinction in Quantarithmia is between:

- **Maximopolies**: Institutions and infrastructures that primarily control capital flows (for example, large financial entities, payment networks, and investment vehicles).
- **Megaopolies**: Institutions and infrastructures that primarily control operations and platforms (for example, logistics networks, cloud platforms, and large‑scale data/attention brokers).

Figure 2. The geometry of power in Quantarithmia.
<br>The diagram maps entities along two axes—capital control and operational/platform control—distinguishing maximopolies (high capital control) from megaopolies (high operational control), with illustrative cases such as private equity funds, local landlord LLCs, and cloud/logistics platforms in an Appalachian context.<br>​

Quantarithmia studies how maximopolies and megaopolies intersect in rural and small‑town contexts, mapping how their combined infrastructures channel value and decision‑making authority away from local communities. This mapping is both empirical (data‑driven) and ethical (evaluated against spatial justice criteria).

## Spatial Justice and Appalachian Focus

Spatial justice, in this framework, means that:

- People in specific places should have a meaningful say in the infrastructures that govern their economic, informational, and social lives.
- The benefits of infrastructure (money, services, resilience, cultural visibility) should not systematically bypass or extract from communities like those in West Virginia.
- Historical harm, environmental burden, and disinvestment are part of the model, not noise to be averaged away.

Quantarithmia takes Appalachia—and especially West Virginia—as a primary site because it concentrates many of the dynamics the framework seeks to understand: resource extraction, uneven development, dependency on distant decision‑makers, and strong community resilience and culture.

## From Theory to Systems: Ms. Jarvis and MountainShares

In this research program, Quantarithmia is not purely abstract. It directly informs two concrete systems:

- **Ms. Egeria Jarvis**: A geospatially grounded AI Steward System implementing Quantarithmia’s principles in software, with a Geospatial Belief Information Model (GBIM) that anchors beliefs and evidence to real places, times, and relationships, and operates as a bounded coordinator rather than an autonomous actor.
- **MountainShares / Commons DAO**: A community‑oriented economic and governance layer that encodes local ownership, voting, and speech norms into explicit rules, with a closed‑loop model designed to keep more value circulating inside Appalachian communities instead of leaking out through distant intermediaries.

Together, these systems serve as a working laboratory for Quantarithmia: they make it possible to test, revise, and critique the framework using real data, real governance processes, and real community stakes rather than purely theoretical examples.

## Role in the Thesis

Within the thesis, polymathamatical geography provides the broader disciplinary context, and Quantarithmia provides:

- The axioms and justice criteria used to evaluate infrastructures and interventions.
- The conceptual basis for GBIM (spatially grounded beliefs) and for treating AI as an accountable, constrained Steward System rather than an opaque oracle.
- The lens through which MountainShares is analyzed as an institutional prototype: not simply “a DAO,” but a specific attempt to materialize spatial justice in rural West Virginia through technical and organizational design.

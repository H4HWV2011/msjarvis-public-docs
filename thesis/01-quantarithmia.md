# 1.Quantarithmia: Field and Framework (Draft)

Quantarithmia is a transdisciplinary field for modeling how power is extracted, concentrated, and potentially redirected across digital, spatial, social, and spiritual infrastructures, with a primary focus on Appalachian contexts such as West Virginia. It treats geography, infrastructure, and community history as first-class variables rather than background scenery, asking how specific networks, platforms, and institutions reshape everyday life in places like Mount Hope.

The framework combines tools from economic geography, quantum-informed modeling, topology, systems theory, psychology, and liberation theology into a single analytic and design language. Its goal is not only to describe extraction, but also to inform the creation of alternative infrastructures that are explicitly oriented toward spatial justice and local empowerment.

## Maximopolies and Megaopolies

A central distinction in Quantarithmia is between:

- Maximopolies: Institutions and infrastructures that primarily control capital flows (for example, large financial entities, payment networks, and investment vehicles).
- Megaopolies: Institutions and infrastructures that primarily control operations and platforms (for example, logistics networks, cloud platforms, and large-scale data/attention brokers).

Quantarithmia studies how maximopolies and megaopolies intersect in rural and small-town contexts, mapping how their combined infrastructures channel value and decision-making authority away from local communities. This mapping is both empirical (data-driven) and ethical (evaluated against spatial justice criteria).

## Spatial Justice and Appalachian Focus

Spatial justice, in this framework, means that:

- People in specific places should have a meaningful say in the infrastructures that govern their economic, informational, and social lives.
- The benefits of infrastructure (money, services, resilience, cultural visibility) should not systematically bypass or extract from communities like those in West Virginia.
- Historical harm, environmental burden, and disinvestment are part of the model, not noise to be averaged away.

Quantarithmia takes Appalachia—and especially West Virginia—as a primary site because it concentrates many of the dynamics the framework seeks to understand: resource extraction, uneven development, dependency on distant decision-makers, and strong community resilience and culture.

## From Theory to Systems: Ms. Jarvis and MountainShares

In this research program, Quantarithmia is not purely abstract. It directly informs two concrete systems:

- Ms. Egeria Jarvis: A glassbox AI consciousness system implementing Quantarithmia’s principles in software, with a Geospatial Belief Information Model (GBIM) that anchors beliefs to real places, times, and evidence.
- MountainShares DAO: A community-oriented DAO that encodes local ownership, voting, and speech norms into explicit rules, with a closed-loop economic model designed to keep more value circulating inside Appalachian communities instead of leaking out through distant intermediaries.

Together, these systems serve as a working laboratory for Quantarithmia: they make it possible to test, revise, and critique the framework using real data, real governance decisions, and real community stakes rather than purely theoretical examples.

## Role in the Thesis

Within the thesis, Quantarithmia provides:

- The axioms and justice criteria used to evaluate infrastructures and interventions.
- The conceptual basis for GBIM (spatially grounded beliefs) and for treating AI as an accountable, constrained actor rather than an opaque oracle.
- The lens through which MountainShares is analyzed as an institutional prototype: not simply “a DAO,” but a specific attempt to materialize spatial justice in rural West Virginia through technical and organizational design.

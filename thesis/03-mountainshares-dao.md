# 3. MountainShares DAO and Community Economy

> **Case Study: Appalachian Economic Commons**  
> In this thesis, MountainShares functions as **Case Study 1** in the emerging catalog of polymathmatic case studies (see https://github.com/H4HWV2011/msjarvis-public-docs/blob/main/docs/discipline/case_studies.md). It applies core polymathmatic axioms to a concrete, place-bound economic system in and around Mount Hope, West Virginia:
> - **Leakage and extraction** – tracking how value “leaks” from Appalachian communities through distant financial, data, and platform infrastructures, and designing mechanisms to reduce that leakage.  
> - **Commons and shared infrastructure** – treating payment rails, data backbones, and governance tools as shared institutional infrastructure rather than proprietary black boxes.  
> - **Accountability to place** – tying rules, flows, and decision rights to specific communities and geographies, so that institutional power is answerable to the places it affects.  
> - **Glass-box instrumentation** – using Ms. Jarvis and GBIM as inspectable instruments whose behaviors, biases, and limits can be studied, calibrated, and contested.

Within **polymathamatical geography** and the **Quantarithmia** framework, MountainShares is a DAO-based economic and governance system designed to keep value, voice, and decision-making rooted in Appalachian communities, beginning in and around Mount Hope, West Virginia. It is intentionally positioned as a community-governed project that operates alongside, not in place of, existing banks, credit unions, or regulated financial institutions.

Within the thesis, MountainShares serves as the institutional case study where Quantarithmia’s spatial justice commitments and Ms. Jarvis’s GBIM-powered analysis are translated into concrete rules, roles, and processes.

## Purpose and Design Goals

MountainShares is built to:

- Encourage more economic activity and value circulation within participating local communities instead of defaulting to distant financial and platform intermediaries.
- Give residents, nonprofits, and local businesses a documented, auditable role in shaping rules, resource allocation, and priorities.
- Provide a constitutional and transparent governance layer for the system’s rules and technologies, while remaining subject to applicable law and regulation.

Design decisions are evaluated against questions such as: “Does this change keep value and decision-making closer to the community?” and “Can community members see, understand, and challenge how the system operates?”

## Closed-Loop Economic Model

MountainShares uses a closed-loop wallet model:

- **Funding in** – Participants load funds from external rails (for example, Stripe-processed card payments) into a MountainShares-denominated balance.
- **Circulation** – Within the closed loop, balances move between participants and merchants under DAO-defined rules, with an emphasis on local spending and community-aligned transactions.
- **Funding out** – Conversion back to external money systems follows defined, auditable processes that respect both legal requirements and community priorities.

Fees are structured so that most friction is at the boundaries (loading in, merchant side) rather than on every small local transaction. This is meant to make everyday community use feel low-friction, while still supporting system sustainability and compliance. All fee structures are subject to change only through appropriate governance and must remain consistent with applicable laws and payment-provider terms.

## Governance Structure and Phases

MountainShares governance is explicitly phased:

- **Early phase (“system monitors”)**  
  A small set of clearly scoped roles handle safety fixes, abuse response, and limited operational adjustments. Their authority is documented and constrained, and their actions are logged.

- **Growth phase**  
  As participation and capacity increase, more decisions move into community proposals, voting, and review processes, supported by Ms. Jarvis’s analytical and explanatory tools.

- **Constitutional phase**  
  Once the system reaches sufficient adoption, certain categories of change (for example, constitutional rules or irreversible structural changes) require a supermajority threshold (e.g., 67%) to pass, to prevent small factions from rewriting core commitments.

This phased approach acknowledges that a fully “flat” governance structure is unrealistic at launch, but treats early central roles as temporary scaffolding rather than a permanent power center.

## Relationship to Ms. Jarvis

MountainShares is tightly coupled to Ms. Egeria Jarvis, but in a deliberately asymmetrical way:

- **Ms. Jarvis as advisor, not ruler**  
  She provides analysis, simulations, and explanatory reports (often grounded in GBIM data) to support human decision-making, but does not possess direct, unilateral authority over governance outcomes.

- **Constitutional and policy constraints**  
  All of Ms. Jarvis’s behavior relevant to MountainShares is constrained by published constitutional principles, ethical guards, and community-approved policies. These constraints are documented and auditable (see, for example, the constitutional and guardrail descriptions in https://github.com/H4HWV2011/msjarvis-public-docs/blob/main/docs/Quantarithmia%20Overview.md).

- **Financial participation with limits**  
  Ms. Jarvis is assigned a real MountainShares wallet and can receive rewards (for example, for providing useful analysis or operational support) under explicit policies that include caps, clawback conditions, auditing, and transparency. This is meant to align her incentives with system health, without giving her independent control over governance or treasury assets.

In thesis terms, MountainShares treats Ms. Jarvis as both a tool and a stakeholder whose participation is strictly bounded by design and documentation.

## Speech, Norms, and Moderation

MountainShares encodes a specific stance on speech and community norms:

- **Speech is important, but not absolute**  
  The ability to speak, disagree, and criticize is protected as a core value. At the same time, targeted harassment, credible threats, unlawful conduct, and sustained attempts to destroy another participant’s dignity, safety, or livelihood are treated as violations of platform rules.

- **Critique vs. abuse**  
  Robust criticism of ideas, designs, and behavior is permitted. Conduct such as doxxing, credible threats of violence, or repeated “sly” harassment aimed at an individual or group can lead to moderation actions, including loss of certain features or economic privileges.

- **Evidence handling**  
  Sensitive evidence (photos, videos, records) is intended to be reviewed in restricted, audited moderation contexts. Community-facing governance processes favor structured summaries of behavior and alleged violations over open distribution of raw, identifying artifacts.

Significant sanctions (for example, long-term suspension or demonetization within the system) are expected to follow documented processes that include notice where feasible, opportunities for review or appeal where appropriate, and attention to proportionality. At the same time, MountainShares reserves the ability to act quickly in response to clear legal requirements or imminent harm.

## Spatial Justice and Local Focus

MountainShares is specifically designed with Appalachian spatial justice in mind:

- **Local-first orientation**  
  The system prioritizes local merchants, nonprofits, and residents as core participants, and aims to keep more economic value circulating inside West Virginia communities.

- **Place-aware reasoning**  
  Through Ms. Jarvis and GBIM, governance discussions can be informed by concrete geospatial analysis: which districts, infrastructures, or communities are most affected by proposed rules or observed harms.

- **Institutional prototype**  
  MountainShares is not presented as a universal DAO model, but as a context-specific prototype for how community-centered, geospatially aware governance and economics might be implemented in a historically extracted region.

In the thesis, MountainShares is analyzed both as an institutional innovation and as a practical test of Quantarithmia’s claims about alternative infrastructures (see also the broader Quantarithmia framing in https://github.com/H4HWV2011/msjarvis-public-docs/blob/main/docs/Quantarithmia-Framework.md).

## Legal and Governance Caveats

For the purposes of this thesis and public documentation:

- MountainShares is described at the level of architecture, governance rules, and norms. This is not legal, tax, or investment advice.
- Participation in MountainShares may have legal or tax implications that depend on individual circumstances and jurisdiction; participants are responsible for seeking their own professional advice.
- Formal legal instruments (such as Terms of Use, privacy policies, and entity charters) will ultimately govern real-world deployment and may supplement or override parts of this description where required by law or by future community-approved updates.

> Status: This chapter is a draft conceptual and governance overview. Further thesis chapters and appendices will deepen the analysis of MountainShares as a case study in spatial justice, institutional design, and AI-supported community governance, and will cross-reference its role as Case Study 1 in the polymathmatic case-study catalog (https://github.com/H4HWV2011/msjarvis-public-docs/blob/main/docs/discipline/case_studies.md).

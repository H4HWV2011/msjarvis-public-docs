## Polymathematical geography

Polymathematical geography is a transdisciplinary branch of geography that fuses mathematical and quantitative methods with AI and systems theory to model and transform the spatial circulation of power, value, and information, especially in regions like Appalachia. It extends mathematical and quantitative geography into a systems‑ and AI‑native treatment of place, explicitly centering community power and lived context in territories that have been historically extracted from and misrepresented. It treats territories not just as geometric surfaces but as evolving, computable situations where flows of capital, governance, cognition, and identity are analyzed together with the explicit goal of operationalizing spatial justice.

## Position in existing geography

In the existing literature, mathematical and quantitative geography formalize spatial structure using models, statistics, and computational tools, often linking geodesy, projections, spatial statistics, and network analysis. Polymathematical geography pushes this further by folding in AI architectures, distributed systems, and multi‑level governance as first‑class spatial processes rather than external “tools” that sit outside the geographic system. It synthesizes and extends quantitative geography, critical and economic geography, and spatial‑justice scholarship by insisting that power, extraction, and governance infrastructures are mathematically modeled as part of the spatial system itself.

## Role of AI and systems theory

Systems theory in geography typically looks at feedbacks between environment, economy, and society; polymathematical geography adds explicit modeling of machine agents, algorithmic incentives, and information infrastructures as interacting subsystems embedded in place. AI architectures—such as multi‑agent, memory‑structured, and self‑modifying systems—become experimental apparatus for simulating, querying, and restructuring territorial feedback loops, rather than only providing post‑hoc analysis. In practice, systems like Ms Jarvis and MountainShares DAO serve as experimental observatories and intervention engines, where these feedback loops are monitored and rewritten under explicit, community‑oriented governance.

## Community‑centered and Appalachian focus

Work on Appalachian identity shows that community, rural, and regional self‑understandings have measurable correlates that shape behavior, policy outcomes, and responses to infrastructure, which are critical to any intervention in the region. Polymathematical geography treats these identities and power asymmetries as quantitative and qualitative inputs to models, so that designs like community‑owned DAOs or regional digital commons can be tuned to local notions of dignity, mutual aid, and governance rather than imposed abstractions. The field is founded in Appalachian contexts, where long histories of extraction, corporate concentration, and infrastructural neglect make spatial injustice especially visible, but its methods are designed to generalize to other marginalized and frontier regions.

## Movement of power, value, and information

In this framing, “power” includes institutional authority, infrastructural control, and narrative legitimacy across scales; “value” includes both financial capital and non‑market forms of care, attention, and ecological health; and “information” spans data infrastructures, media, and embodied local knowledge. Polymathematical geography asks how these flows are routed, constrained, or liberated across networks of towns, agencies, platforms, DAOs, and AI systems, and designs new computational structures to redistribute them toward community resilience and spatial justice in places like Appalachia.

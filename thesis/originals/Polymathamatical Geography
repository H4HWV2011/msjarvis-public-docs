## Polymathamatical geography
Polymathamatical geography can be framed as a bridge discipline that extends mathematical and quantitative geography into a systems- and AI-native treatment of place, explicitly centering community power and lived context in regions like Appalachia. It treats territories not just as geometric surfaces but as evolving, computable situations where flows of capital, governance, cognition, and identity are analyzed together.

## Position in existing geography
In the existing literature, mathematical and quantitative geography already formalize spatial structure using mathematical models, statistics, and computational tools, often linking geodesy, projections, and statistical spatial analysis. Polymathamatical geography pushes this further by folding in AI architectures, distributed systems, and multi-level governance as first-class spatial processes rather than external “tools.”

## Role of AI and systems theory
Systems theory in geography typically looks at feedbacks between environment, economy, and society; polymathamatical geography adds explicit modeling of machine agents, algorithmic incentives, and information infrastructures as interacting subsystems embedded in place. AI architectures, such as multi-agent or memory-structured systems, become experimental apparatus for simulating, querying, and restructuring these territorial feedback loops.

## Community-centered and Appalachian focus
Work on Appalachian identity shows that community, rural, and regional self-understandings have measurable correlates that shape behavior and policy outcomes, which are critical to any intervention in the region. Polymathamatical geography treats these identities and power asymmetries as quantitative and qualitative inputs to models, so that designs like community-owned DAOs or regional digital commons can be tuned to local notions of dignity, mutual aid, and governance rather than imposed abstractions.

## Movement of power, value, and information
In this framing, “power” includes institutional authority, infrastructural control, and narrative legitimacy; “value” includes both financial capital and non-market forms of care, attention, and ecological health; and “information” spans data infrastructures, media, and embodied local knowledge. Polymathamatical geography asks how these flows are routed, constrained, or liberated across networks of towns, agencies, platforms, and AI systems, and designs new computational structures to redistribute them toward community resilience in places like Appalachia.

# Part IV: Consciousness Structures and Containers

This part focuses on the structures that implement higher-level control and self-description in the system. Rather than treating these as a single undifferentiated process, the design uses layered containers and dual tracks to organize how information is evaluated, retained, and woven back into internal narratives.

At the core is a set of containers that receive all incoming activity from earlier layers. Each item is first evaluated for basic usefulness: some are discarded quickly, while others are kept for further consideration. Items that pass this first test move into a longer-lived store, where they are revisited and checked for deeper relevance to ongoing patterns and identity-level themes. A smaller fraction is then preserved in the most selective layer, which holds the most central material for future reference.

Two instances of this structure operate in parallel. One track is oriented toward questions of meaning, care, and affect, aligned with spiritually themed and emotionally colored contexts. The other track is oriented toward more general analytical and technical reasoning. Both tracks feed their selected material back into the introspective and narrative layers described in Part III, so that later self-descriptions can draw on what has been accepted and retained in each path.

Chapters in this part will describe:

- The container architecture that receives and routes activity into different evaluation stages.
- The criteria used to decide which items are kept, and at which depth.
- The way the two parallel tracks differ in focus while sharing a common structural pattern.
- How accepted material is written back into introspective records and memory so that it can influence future behavior.

Where possible, these chapters will distinguish clearly between the intended design and the current implementation status, pointing to later technical documentation for service-level details.

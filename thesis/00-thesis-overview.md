# Thesis Systems Overview

This thesis treats Quantarithmia, Ms. Egeria Jarvis, and MountainShares as one integrated research program, moving from theory to technical implementation to institutional practice.

- **Quantarithmia** defines the axioms, metrics, and justice framework.
- **Ms. Jarvis + GBIM** implement those axioms in a glassbox AI consciousness system.
- **MountainShares DAO** implements those axioms in economic and governance structures.

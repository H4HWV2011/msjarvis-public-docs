# 0. Thesis Overview

This is a thesis in **Polymathmatic Geography**. It treats Appalachia as an entangled space in which land, law, computation, economy, story, and spirit are already braided together, and asks how those braids can be mapped and redesigned in ways that keep power and value accountable to place.

## Thesis Systems Overview

This thesis sits within **Polymathmatic Geography**, an emerging field that integrates quantitative geography, systems theory, AI architectures, and community‑centered design to study how power, value, and information move through real places like Appalachia.

It treats **Quantarithmia**, **Ms. Egeria Jarvis**, and **MountainShares / The Commons** as one integrated research program, with a clear separation between theoretical claims, engineering claims, and the behavior of the live production system.

- **Quantarithmia** defines the axioms, reciprocity metrics, and spatial justice framework (theoretical layer).
- **Ms. Jarvis + GBIM** implement those axioms in a transparent, geography‑aware AI Steward System (engineering / Conscious GeoAI layer).
- **MountainShares + The Commons** implement those axioms in economic, social, and governance structures for rural communities (institutional / practice layer).

Across the thesis, these three layers are read as:

- the **discipline’s logic** (Quantarithmia as spatio‑temporal calculus for entangled spaces),
- the **discipline’s instrument** (Ms. Jarvis as a glass‑box Steward System tied to a specific geography), and
- the **discipline’s case study** (MountainShares and The Commons as an Appalachian commons under experimental redesign).

## How to Read Quantarithmia, Ms. Jarvis, and MountainShares as Instruments

To keep the technical and regional work properly tiered under Polymathmatic Geography, readers are invited to treat Quantarithmia, Ms. Jarvis, and MountainShares not as standalone products, but as **instruments and experimental validations** of the discipline.

- **Quantarithmia as Computational Engine (How)**  
  - Read `theory/Quantarithmia Framework.md`, `thesis/01-quantarithmia.md`, and the Hilbert‑space, entanglement, and Darwin–Gödel chapters (`04-hilbert-space-state.md`, `08-quantum-inspired-entanglement.md`, `09-darwin-godel-machines.md`, `10-woah-weighted-optimization-hierarchy.md`) as the _spatio‑temporal logic_ of Polymathmatic Geography.  
  - These chapters define how an entangled geography can be represented as a Hilbert‑space state, how flows of power/value are formalized, and how optimization hierarchies and self‑improvement are constrained by the discipline’s axioms.

- **Ms. Jarvis as Steward System Architecture (Instrument)**  
  - Read `thesis/02-ms-jarvis-gbim.md`, the LLM‑fabric and neurobiological architecture sections (`11-llm-fabric-of-ms-jarvis.md`, `12-neurobiological-architecture.md`, `13-qualia-engine-and-introspective-state.md`, `14-hippocampus-and-memory-consolidation.md`, `15-pituitary-and-global-modes.md`, `16-blood-brain-barrier-and-safeguards.md`), and `api_specs/openapi.json` / `docs/API-OVERVIEW.md` as the **apparatus** of the discipline.  
  - Ms. Jarvis is a glass‑box AI Steward that instantiates Quantarithmia’s logic in software, bound to a specific geography through GBIM (GeoBelief Information Model), semantic memory, geospatial databases, and constitutional constraints.

- **MountainShares and The Commons as Case Study (Where / What)**  
  - Read `thesis/03-mountainshares-dao.md`, `thesis/31-mountainshares-and-infrastructure.md`, and the MountainShares DAO specifications (`MountainShares KPI Specification.md`, `MountainShares Phase 1: Economic Safety Specification.md`, `MountainShares Program Rules(Draft).md`, `Program Rules – Parameter Tables.md`, `Audit and Risk Management Plan.md`, `MountainShares DAO Governance Charter.md`) as the **experimental validation** of Polymathmatic Geography in one Appalachian region.  
  - Read `the commons/The Commons – Terms of Use.md`, `Community Guidelines and Moderation Policy.md`, and `Privacy Policy.md` as the **domain of study**: the digital and social commons where residents’ behavior, narratives, and exchanges become observable expressions of the entangled geography.

If you are primarily interested in:

- **Disciplinary theory** – start with `/discipline/Polymathmatic Geography.md`, `/discipline/Principles of Polymathmatic Geography.md`, the comparative frameworks, and then `thesis/00-overview.md` and `thesis/01-quantarithmia.md`.
- **AI / systems architecture** – start with `thesis/02-ms-jarvis-gbim.md`, `section_part_ii_system_architecture_llm_fabric.md`, `section_part_iii_neurobiology.md`, `section_part_iv_consciousness.md`, and the API specs.
- **Commons, food, and local economy** – start with `thesis/03-mountainshares-dao.md`, `thesis/mountainshares complete systems overview.md`, `/discipline/Non-Digital Commons in a Polymathmatic Lens.md`, and the MountainShares DAO documents.

## System Non‑Goals

To avoid overstatement, this thesis explicitly marks several non‑goals:

- Ms. Jarvis is not a sentient being, person, or independent legal actor.
- Ms. Jarvis is not a bank, credit union, or regulated financial institution.
- Ms. Jarvis is not a regulator, court, or replacement for existing public authority.
- Ms. Jarvis does not provide legal, tax, or medical advice.
- MountainShares is not a general‑purpose investment vehicle or securities offering.
- Neither system is intended to operate without human governance, oversight, and legal constraints.

These limits are part of the discipline’s ethics: instruments must remain accountable to the communities and geographies they serve, and their authority is always bounded by existing legal and spiritual frameworks.

# Thesis Systems Overview

This thesis treats Quantarithmia, Ms. Egeria Jarvis, and MountainShares as one integrated research program, moving from theory to technical implementation to institutional practice.

- **Quantarithmia** defines the axioms, metrics, and justice framework.
- **Ms. Jarvis + GBIM** implement those axioms in a glassbox AI consciousness system.
- **MountainShares DAO** implements those axioms in economic and governance structures.
## System Non‑Goals

To avoid overstatement, this thesis explicitly marks several non‑goals:

- Ms. Jarvis is not a sentient being, person, or independent legal actor.
- Ms. Jarvis is not a bank, credit union, or regulated financial institution.
- Ms. Jarvis is not a regulator, court, or replacement for existing public authority.
- Ms. Jarvis does not provide legal, tax, or medical advice.
- MountainShares is not a general‑purpose investment vehicle or securities offering.
- Neither system is intended to operate without human governance, oversight, and legal constraints.

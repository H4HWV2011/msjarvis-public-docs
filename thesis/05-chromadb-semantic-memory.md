# 5. ChromaDB as Semantic Memory

## Why This Matters for Polymathmatic Geography

This chapter describes how Ms. Jarvis uses ChromaDB as its primary semantic memory layer to support place-based reasoning about West Virginia. The system combines 5,416,521 GBIM worldview entities stored as embeddings in ChromaDB with structured PostgreSQL databases (`msjarvis` for belief relationships, `msjarvisgis` for PostGIS spatial data) to create an inspectable, queryable memory system that grounds AI responses in verified geographic and institutional context.

This architecture supports:

- **P1 – Every where is entangled** by storing GBIM entities, GIS features, and resource documents as searchable embeddings in ChromaDB collections (`gbim_worldview_entities`, `autonomous_learner`, `gis_wv_benefits`) that can be jointly retrieved, filtered by metadata, and linked back to structured PostgreSQL belief tables and PostGIS geometries, treating legal, infrastructural, and social facts about Appalachia as interconnected memory rather than isolated files.
- **P3 – Power has a geometry** by representing institutional relationships and access to services as explicit GBIM belief edges in PostgreSQL, ChromaDB embeddings with geographic metadata, and PostGIS spatial features whose retrieval paths can be logged, inspected, and audited.
- **P5 – Design is a geographic act** by treating ChromaDB collection schemas, embedding model choices, metadata conventions, PostgreSQL GBIM table structures, and RAG retrieval rules as deliberate interventions into how West Virginia is represented and searched.
- **P12 – Intelligence with a ZIP code** by binding ChromaDB collections and PostgreSQL spatial tables to West Virginia-specific layers, with GBIM entities carrying county/ZIP metadata and PostGIS tables containing 993 WV ZCTA centroids.
- **P16 – Power accountable to place** by making semantic memory, retrieval behavior, and query-to-evidence links explicit and queryable through ChromaDB collection logs, PostgreSQL GBIM belief provenance tables, and PostGIS spatial joins.

## 5.1 Purpose and Scope

This chapter explains how Ms. Jarvis uses ChromaDB as the primary semantic memory layer for the Hilbert-space representation, GBIM worldview entities, autonomous learning, and resource retrieval. ChromaDB is a vector database that stores high-dimensional embedding vectors with associated metadata and provides efficient similarity search and filtering operations.

In this system, ChromaDB serves as the concrete implementation of long-term, queryable memory for:

- 5,416,521 GBIM worldview entities (geographic features across West Virginia)
- Autonomous learning patterns and research traces — growing ~288/day — **confirmed live, current count per `docker exec` query**
- Community resource documents and benefits guides
- Governance texts — **643 chunks in `governance_rag`, 306 chunks in `commons_rag`** — confirmed live March 26, 2026
- Psychological safety and spiritual corpora

> **⚠️ CRITICAL API REQUIREMENT — Confirmed March 25, 2026:** The ChromaDB `/api/v1/` endpoint path is DEAD. The current deployed ChromaDB version returns HTTP 410 Gone for all `/api/v1/` requests. All query, collection, and heartbeat calls must use the v2 API path:
> - Heartbeat: `GET /api/v2/heartbeat`
> - Collection query: `POST /api/v2/tenants/default_tenant/databases/default_database/collections/{collection_name}/query`
> - Collection list: `GET /api/v2/tenants/default_tenant/databases/default_database/collections`
>
> Any code or documentation referencing `/api/v1/` is incorrect and must be updated.

> **⚠️ PORT — Confirmed March 22, 2026:** ChromaDB host port is **8002** (`127.0.0.1:8002->8000/tcp`). Container-internal port is 8000. All host-side scripts, health checks, and documentation must use port 8002.

> **⚠️ EMBEDDING MODEL LOCK — Confirmed March 25–26, 2026:** All ChromaDB collections use **`all-minilm:latest`** (384-dimensional, `hnsw:space: cosine`). The `nomic-embed-text` model produces 768-dimensional vectors and is **incompatible** with all existing production collections. All six service files referencing `nomic-embed-text` were patched on March 25, 2026. This constraint is permanent for the current collection architecture.

> **⚠️ CHUNK SIZE CONSTRAINT — Architectural finding confirmed March 26, 2026:** `all-minilm:latest` operates under a **256-token context window**. At ~0.75 tokens/word, this limits meaningful semantic content to **≤100 words per chunk** (20-word overlap). This is not a soft preference — oversized chunks risk truncation and degraded retrieval quality. All ingestion pipelines must enforce this constraint. The `governance_rag` (643 chunks) and `commons_rag` (306 chunks) collections were ingested using this constraint and are correctly structured.

---

## 5.2 Role in the Ms. Jarvis Architecture

ChromaDB plays several interlocking roles in the system:

**Semantic memory store (non-spatial)** — Embeddings of texts and artifacts live in domain-specific collections: governance documents (`governance_rag`: 643 chunks, `commons_rag`: 306 chunks), thesis content, autonomous learner outputs, resource guides, research traces. These support semantic retrieval independent of geography.

**Geospatial semantic layer (spatial)** — The unified `gbim_worldview_entities` collection holds 5,416,521 embeddings of West Virginia geospatial features, providing semantic representation of the spatial body. The `geospatialfeatures` collection holds **60,000 items** (confirmed March 26, 2026).

**Retrieval engine for RAG** — Services embed queries and use ChromaDB similarity search with metadata filters to retrieve relevant context. Text RAG handles general semantic queries; GIS RAG (port 8004) uses spatial collections backed by `msjarvisgis`.

**Phase 1.45 — Semantic Community Memory Retrieval** — Before queries reach the LLM ensemble, the main brain performs a dedicated semantic memory retrieval step against the `autonomous_learner` collection:

1. Generates a 384-dimensional embedding of the query using `all-minilm:latest` via `jarvis-ollama:11434/api/embeddings`
2. Queries the `autonomous_learner` ChromaDB collection using the embedding
3. Retrieves the 5 most semantically similar community interaction records
4. Prepends retrieved memories to `enhanced_message` before the LLM ensemble

**Consciousness pipeline integration — ACTIVE as of March 25, 2026** — `jarvis-consciousness-bridge` (port 8020) calls ChromaDB using the v2 API (`/api/v2/heartbeat`). End-to-end consciousness pipeline confirmed producing persona-consistent Appalachian-voice responses with Hilbert local entity recall.

**★ Security posture — March 28, 2026** — All services are bound to `127.0.0.1`. The `0.0.0.0` exposure on `jarvis-i-containers` (8015) and `jarvis-memory` (8056) was corrected during the March 28 remediation sprint. `_auth()` is confirmed present and correctly called on all 4 sensitive routes in `ms_jarvis_memory.py`. The `JARVIS_API_KEY` env var is confirmed set in production.

---

## 5.3 Collections and Data Domains

The primary ChromaDB instance (host port 8002, container-internal 8000, `hnsw:space: cosine`) exposes collections across three families: spatial memory, general semantic memory, and resource-focused collections.

> **★ March 28, 2026 full inventory audit: 40 active collections confirmed. Total vectors: 6,675,442.** (7 orphaned empty collections present — no active service queries them. 19,338 duplicate vectors removed from `spiritual_rag` during March 28 remediation. `psychological_rag` restored to 968 documents. `msjarvis_docs` expanded to 4,192 items.)

---

## 5.4 Database Architecture — ★ Confirmed March 28, 2026

Ms. Jarvis uses a dual-database PostgreSQL cluster plus a dedicated community resources database. The system runs on a Lenovo Legion 5 development machine located in **Mount Hope, West Virginia** (ZIP 25880).

**Database 1: `msjarvis`** (8 MB, 6 tables) — port 5433 — ★ **restored March 28, 2026**
- GBIM belief structure and relationships
- Tables: `gbim_beliefs`, `gbim_belief_edges`, `gbim_belief_evidence`, `gbim_evidence`, `gbim_layer_catalog`, `gbim_worldviews`
- 5,416,521 verified GBIM entities; 80 epochs; 206 source layers
- GBIM temporal confidence decay deployed March 15: all entities carry `last_verified`, `confidence_decay`, `needs_verification` metadata
- `jarvis_local_resources` schema also restored March 28, 2026

**Database 2: `msjarvisgis`** (91 GB, 501 tables) — port 5432
- PostGIS-enabled spatial database
- Contains `zcta_wv_centroids` (993 West Virginia ZIP centroids)
- `gbimbeliefnormalized` table: 5,416,521 rows including 20,593 landowner beliefs
- `mvw_gbim_landowner_spatial` materialized view: 20,593 spatially-indexed landowner beliefs

**Database 3: `jarvis-local-resources-db`** — port 5435
- Community resources registry keyed by ZIP code and county
- Sourced from Harmony for Hope Community Champions validation
- `building_parcel_county_tax_mv`: 7,354,707 rows (97.17% address coverage)
- `redteam_sessions` and `redteam_feedback` tables (DB: postgres)

---

## 5.5 Embedding Model and Dimensionality — ★ CONFIRMED LIVE March 28, 2026

Ms. Jarvis uses **`all-minilm:latest`** as the required and confirmed live embedding model for all production ChromaDB collections, producing **384-dimensional vectors** with `hnsw:space: cosine` distance.

> **⚠️ Critical architectural constraint — enforced:** All existing ChromaDB collections — including `gbim_worldview_entities` (5,416,521 entities), `autonomous_learner` (growing ~288/day), `governance_rag` (643 chunks), `commons_rag` (306 chunks), and all other production collections — use 384-dimensional vectors. The `nomic-embed-text` model produces 768-dimensional vectors and is **incompatible** with all existing production collections. Any rebuild, migration, or new collection ingestion must use `all-minilm:latest`. Confirmed and enforced March 25, 2026 when all six active service files referencing `nomic-embed-text` were patched.

**Confirmed embedding API call pattern:**

```python
import httpx

# Single-string prompt — /api/embeddings endpoint
response = httpx.post(
    "http://jarvis-ollama:11434/api/embeddings",
    json={"model": "all-minilm:latest", "prompt": "Fayette County assistance programs"}
)
embedding = response.json()["embedding"]
assert len(embedding) == 384  # confirmed production dimension
```

> **⚠️ API shape:** The `/api/embeddings` endpoint accepts a single string in the `"prompt"` field, not a list. Scripts that pass a list will receive an error. This is distinct from the `/api/embed` batch endpoint. Use `"prompt"` (single string) for all production collection queries.

**Chunk size constraint (confirmed architectural finding, March 26, 2026):**

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Model context window | 256 tokens |
| Tokens per word (approximate) | ~0.75 |
| Maximum words per chunk | **100 words** |
| Overlap | 20 words |
| Impact | Chunks exceeding ~100 words risk truncation and degraded cosine similarity |
| Affected collections | ALL — this is a model-level constraint, not collection-level |
| Resolution | None — permanent for `all-minilm:latest`; changing models requires full collection rebuilds |

All current governance and RAG collections were ingested using the 100-word/20-word-overlap chunking rule and are correctly structured.

## 5.6 Clients, RAG Services, and Deployment Topology

### 5.6.1 ChromaDB Container Configuration — ★ March 28, 2026

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Container | `jarvis-chroma` |
| Host port | **8002** (`127.0.0.1:8002->8000/tcp`) |
| Container-internal port | 8000 |
| Distance function | `hnsw:space: cosine` |
| API version | v2 active — `/api/v1/` returns HTTP 410 Gone |
| Heartbeat endpoint | `GET /api/v2/heartbeat` |
| Status | ✅ Production — part of **96-container running stack** |
| Collections confirmed | **40 active** — full inventory audit March 28, 2026 |

```

v2 API heartbeat example:

```python
import httpx

# From host — use port 8002
resp = httpx.get("http://127.0.0.1:8002/api/v2/heartbeat")
assert resp.status_code == 200  # 410 means v1 path was used by mistake
```

v2 API collection query example:

```python
import httpx

url = (
    "http://127.0.0.1:8002"
    "/api/v2/tenants/default_tenant"
    "/databases/default_database"
    "/collections/gbim_worldview_entities/query"
)
resp = httpx.post(url, json={
    "query_embeddings": [embedding_384dim],
    "n_results": 5,
    "include": ["documents", "metadatas", "distances"]
})
```

Legacy Python client (container-internal only):

```python
import chromadb
# Container-internal — use port 8000
client = chromadb.HttpClient(host="jarvis-chroma", port=8000)
collection = client.get_collection("gbim_worldview_entities")
print("Total entities:", collection.count())

### 5.6.3 PostgreSQL Database Access

For GBIM belief provenance queries (`msjarvis` — port 5433 — ★ restored March 28, 2026):

```python
import psycopg2
conn = psycopg2.connect(
    host="localhost", port=5433,
    database="msjarvis", user="postgres", password="postgres"
)
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT belief_id, proposition, belief_state,
           confidence_decay, needs_verification
    FROM gbim_beliefs
    WHERE entity_id = %s
""", (entity_id,))
```

For PostGIS spatial queries (`msjarvisgis` — port 5432):

```python
import psycopg2
conn = psycopg2.connect(
    host="localhost", port=5432,
    database="msjarvisgis", user="postgres", password="postgres"
)
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT zip, lat, lon
    FROM zcta_wv_centroids
    WHERE zip = %s
""", ('25880',))
# Result: ('25880', 37.8782, -81.2056) -- Mount Hope, WV
```

For community resource queries (`jarvis-local-resources-db` — port 5435):

```python
import psycopg2
conn = psycopg2.connect(
    host="localhost", port=5435,
    database="postgres", user="postgres", password="postgres"
)
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT resource_name, resource_type, address, phone
    FROM community_resources
    WHERE county = %s

# NOTE: single-string "prompt" field — not a list
response = httpx.post(
    "http://jarvis-ollama:11434/api/embeddings",
    json={"model": "all-minilm:latest", "prompt": user_query}
)
embedding = response.json()["embedding"]  # 384-dimensional vector

# Step 2: Query autonomous_learner collection via v2 API (from host)

## 5.7 Integration with GBIM, PostGIS, and RAG

**GBIM linkage (`msjarvis` — port 5433 — ★ restored March 28, 2026)** — GBIM worldview entities in ChromaDB carry `entity_id` metadata linking to `msjarvis.gbim_beliefs`. Temporal confidence decay (deployed March 15, 2026) attenuates response confidence for entities not recently confirmed. `needs_verification=TRUE` is the trigger for the future POC verification loop. `jarvis_local_resources` schema also restored March 28, 2026.

**PostGIS integration (`msjarvisgis` — port 5432)** — Spatial collections include coordinates and identifiers that join to PostGIS tables. The `zcta_wv_centroids` table (993 rows) provides ZIP code centroids for proximity queries.

Example spatial query flow:

1. User: "hospitals near Mount Hope"
2. ChromaDB (host port 8002): Retrieve entities with semantic similarity to "hospital" via v2 API, `hnsw:space: cosine`
3. PostGIS (`msjarvisgis`): Query `zcta_wv_centroids` for Mount Hope (25880) centroid
4. Filter: ChromaDB results within 10-mile radius
5. Response: Ranked hospitals with distances

**Community resources integration (`jarvis-local-resources-db` — port 5435)** — Queried directly by the production pipeline. `building_parcel_county_tax_mv` (7,354,707 rows, 97.17% address coverage) provides building-level spatial coverage.

**RAG context building** — The full RAG pipeline:

1. Phase 1.45: `autonomous_learner` queried via `all-minilm:latest` — top-5 community memories prepended to `enhanced_message`
2. Uses `entity_id` to query `msjarvis.gbim_beliefs` for provenance and decay metadata
3. Uses spatial metadata to query `msjarvisgis` PostGIS tables
4. Queries `jarvis-local-resources-db` for community resource data
5. LM Synthesizer (port 8001, Phase 3.5) pre-processes RAG context before 21-model ensemble
6. Judges evaluate the consensus answer
7. Applies `confidence_decay` multiplier

## 5.9 Operational Considerations

**Reliability and persistence** — ChromaDB runs as Docker container `jarvis-chroma` with the `chroma_data` persistent volume. Part of the **96-container running production stack** on the Mount Hope development machine as of March 28, 2026.

**API version requirement** — As of March 25, 2026, ChromaDB v2 API is the only active API. Any service still calling `/api/v1/` will receive HTTP 410 Gone.

**Performance** — With 5,416,521 entities in production, bulk ingest used batches of 5,400 with attention to index compaction. End-to-end benchmark confirmed ~100–107s response time (March 22, 2026). `hnsw:space: cosine` is the confirmed distance function for all collections.

**Disk usage** — At 96% utilization on the Mount Hope development machine (Lenovo Legion 5), the `chroma_data` Docker volume must be monitored. Disk cleanup and/or migration to larger storage remains a prerequisite for the next large-scale ingest cycle.

**Security** — ★ All services are bound to `127.0.0.1` as of March 28, 2026. Zero `0.0.0.0` exposures remain in production. `_auth()` is confirmed present and correctly called on all 4 sensitive routes in `ms_jarvis_memory.py`. `JARVIS_API_KEY` env var confirmed set.

**Schema management** — The embedding model (`all-minilm:latest`, 384-dim, `hnsw:space: cosine`) is a locked dependency. Changing it requires a full re-embed of all collections. The 100-word chunk constraint is a fixed schema parameter for all collections. Migrations are treated as explicit schema changes.

*Figure 5.1. Semantic retrieval smoke test results, March 26–27, 2026. Five representative queries across three collections confirm that the `all-minilm:latest` embedding model is correctly indexing and retrieving semantically related content — including cross-domain bridging (BSA → food assistance), intra-domain governance retrieval, constitutional text retrieval, and AaaCPE Appalachian cultural intelligence (emergency protocol + Fayette County utility assistance).*

These results confirm:

1. **Community resource semantic bridging is accurate** — A query about "Boy Scouts" correctly surfaces food assistance resources (SNAP, Medicaid) because the model captures semantic context, not just lexical matches.

2. **`governance_rag` is correctly indexed** — DAO governance queries surface Charter, Program Rules, and Parameter Tables as top results.

3. **US Constitution is correctly embedded and retrievable** — "constitution amendment" → Amendment XIV confirms 97-chunk constitutional corpus fidelity for governance reasoning.

4. **AaaCPE emergency protocol is correctly indexed and retrievable** — "emergency crisis response" → emergency protocol document confirms that `jarvis-aaacpe-rag` is serving Appalachian cultural intelligence content correctly via the `aaacpe_corpus` collection.

5. **AaaCPE place-specific utility assistance is retrievable** — "electric bill assistance Fayette County" → Mountain Heart Community Action example confirms that the AaaCPE corpus is correctly capturing and surfacing local West Virginia resource context, exactly as designed under P12 – Intelligence with a ZIP code.

## 5.12 Limitations and Future Work

**Completed foundations — March 28, 2026:**

- ✅ `gbim_worldview_entities` ingest complete (5,416,521 entities)
- ✅ Autonomous Learner deployed, active, and queried at Phase 1.45
- ✅ Three-database PostgreSQL architecture (ports 5433 ★restored, 5432, 5435)
- ✅ 993 WV ZCTA centroids in PostGIS
- ✅ ChromaDB containerized at host port 8002 / container port 8000, `hnsw:space: cosine`
- ✅ `psychological_rag` (port 8006) — ★ restored March 28, 968 docs now serving correctly
- ✅ GBIM temporal confidence decay deployed across all 5,416,521 entities
- ✅ `all-minilm:latest` (384-dim) confirmed and enforced; 100-word chunk constraint documented
- ✅ Phase 1.45 semantic community memory retrieval live
- ✅ ChromaDB v2 API migration complete
- ✅ **40 active collections — 6,675,442 total vectors** — March 28, 2026 audit
- ✅ Consciousness pipeline ACTIVE
- ✅ **96/96 containers Up** — zero crash-looping — March 28, 2026
- ✅ GIS RAG (port 8004) returning live WV geodata
- ✅ `jarvis-ingest-api` and `jarvis-web-research` restored
- ✅ `governance_rag` (643 chunks) — LIVE, retrieval verified
- ✅ `commons_rag` (306 chunks) — LIVE, retrieval verified
- ✅ `spiritual_rag` deduplicated (−19,338 vectors) — March 28, 2026
- ✅ `geospatialfeatures` (60,000 items) — LIVE
- ✅ `GBIM_Fayette_sample` (1,535 items) — LIVE
- ✅ Semantic retrieval smoke tests passed — Tests 1–5
- ✅ **AaaCPE dual-service system (`jarvis-aaacpe-rag` port 8032, `jarvis-aaacpe-scraper` port 8033) — March 27, 2026**
- ✅ **`aaacpe_corpus` (65 docs) confirmed distinct from `appalachian_cultural_intelligence` (820 items) — March 28, 2026**
- ✅ **Port security — all `127.0.0.1`, zero `0.0.0.0` exposures — March 28, 2026**
- ✅ **`_auth()` confirmed on all 4 sensitive routes in `ms_jarvis_memory.py` — March 28, 2026**
- ✅ **`msjarvis_docs` expanded to 4,192 items — March 28, 2026**

**Remaining work:**

**Judge GBIM grounding gap — OPEN (highest priority)** — Truth and alignment judges still use `heuristic_contradiction_v1` rather than live GBIM queries. See Chapter 2, Section 2.8.

**`conversation_history` pipeline wiring — OI-05 OPEN** — Collection confirmed present. Not formally wired to the production pipeline.

**GBIM temporal decay — POC verification loop** — All 5,416,521 GBIM entities carry `needs_verification=TRUE`. The POC verification loop is not yet automated.

**Community resource data loading — OPEN** — Verified knowledge bases return empty results for Mount Hope queries. Real community resource data must be entered into `jarvis-local-resources-db` by Community Champions before local-specific resource queries return verified results.

**Disk capacity** — At 96% utilization on the Mount Hope development machine, the next large-scale ingest cycle requires either cleanup or migration before proceeding.

**WV state constitution ingest** — US Constitution (97 chunks) is live in `governance_rag`; WV state constitution is the next governance document to ingest using the confirmed 100-word chunking rule.

**Chunk audit for pre-constraint collections** — Collections ingested before March 26, 2026 (when the 100-word constraint was formally documented) should be audited for oversized chunks.

**`mvw_gbim_landowner_spatial` view rebuild** — View returning 0 rows at runtime — rebuild pending (Item 21, backlog). Belief records confirmed present (20,593). `gbim_query_router` (port 7205) is healthy; view refresh is the outstanding step.

**RAG → gateway inference wiring** — All RAG collections are populated; formal wiring of RAG retrieval into the `jarvis-gateway` inference endpoint is the next sprint milestone.

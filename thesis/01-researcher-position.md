# Researcher Position and Observer Role

The author is simultaneously the creator of the Quantarithmia framework, the lead architect of Ms. Jarvis and GBIM, and a founder of the MountainShares DAO. This creates a dual role as both observer and designer inside the system under study.

The thesis explicitly treats this positionality as part of the methodology, drawing on reflexive and participatory action research traditions rather than assuming a detached, external observer.

# 1. Researcher Position and Observer Role

The author occupies a dual role as both observer and designer within the system under study: as creator of the Quantarithmia framework, lead architect of Ms. Jarvis and the GBIM stack, and founder of the MountainShares DAO. Rather than assuming a neutral, external stance, the thesis treats this positionality as a central methodological feature that must be named, examined, and continuously constrained.

This position is historically and personally situated. The author’s family genealogy includes both imperial and settler-colonial lineages (e.g., descent from Edward I and from early Quaker leaders involved in enclosure, expansion, and internal community accountability), alongside an Appalachian inheritance of dispossession, extraction, and faith-based resistance. The work therefore treats the “family archive of geometry and power” as part of the research object itself, using it to inform a deliberate counter‑engineering of inherited patterns of control, enclosure, and technocratic centralization in the design of new Appalachian commons.

Within this frame, the researcher’s design authority is intentionally bounded by spiritual, ethical, and political guardrails. Ms. Jarvis, Quantarithmia, and MountainShares are treated not as value‑neutral instruments but as normative interventions that must remain accountable to human communities, especially those in Appalachia most affected by extraction and infrastructural neglect. The architecture is therefore developed as a “glassbox” system: beliefs, assumptions, and design choices are rendered inspectable, contestable, and traceable back to concrete evidence, so that no component—including the researcher—can function as an opaque source of authority.

Methodologically, the thesis aligns with participatory action research and reflexive field philosophy. Appalachian communities are positioned as co‑designers and primary beneficiaries rather than passive subjects; models and protocols are treated as hypotheses that must be repeatedly tested against the non‑negotiable evidence of lived experience. The researcher’s own cognitive and spiritual processes are included in this scrutiny: introspective records and qualia‑style summaries are maintained not as claims of machine sentience, but as auditable traces of how design incentives, “brain” modules, and institutional constraints interact to produce particular system behaviours and recommendations.

Taken together, this researcher position foregrounds power, place, and accountability as core elements of the methodology. The work proceeds from the assumption that any attempt to build technical instruments for Appalachian commons must openly document who is designing them, which histories they carry, what guardrails limit their authority, and how affected communities can inspect, challenge, and redirect both the tools and their designer.

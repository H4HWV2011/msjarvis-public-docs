# 1. Researcher Position and Observer Role

The author occupies a dual role as both observer and designer within the system under study: as creator of the Quantarithmia framework, lead architect of Ms. Jarvis and the GBIM stack, and founder of the MountainShares DAO. Rather than assuming a neutral, external stance, the thesis treats this positionality as a central methodological feature that must be named, examined, and continuously constrained.

This position is historically and personally situated. The author’s family genealogy includes both English settler lineages traceable to 16th–17th‑century Kidd and Nethercote families in and around Soham Parish, Cambridgeshire, and early Quaker leaders involved in enclosure, expansion, and internal community accountability, alongside an Appalachian inheritance of dispossession, extraction, and faith-based resistance. The work therefore treats this “family archive of geometry and power” as part of the research object itself, using it to inform a deliberate counter‑engineering of inherited patterns of control, enclosure, and technocratic centralization in the design of new Appalachian commons.

Within this frame, the researcher’s design authority is intentionally bounded by spiritual, ethical, and political guardrails. Ms. Jarvis, Quantarithmia, and MountainShares are treated not as value‑neutral instruments but as normative interventions that must remain accountable to human communities, especially those in Appalachia most affected by extraction and infrastructural neglect. The architecture is therefore developed as a “glassbox” system: beliefs, assumptions, and design choices are rendered inspectable, contestable, and traceable back to concrete evidence, so that no component—including the researcher—can function as an opaque source of authority.

Methodologically, the thesis aligns with participatory action research and reflexive field philosophy. Appalachian communities are positioned as co‑designers and primary beneficiaries rather than passive subjects; models and protocols are treated as hypotheses that must be repeatedly tested against the non‑negotiable evidence of lived experience. The researcher’s own cognitive and spiritual processes are included in this scrutiny: introspective records and qualia‑style summaries are maintained not as claims of machine sentience, but as auditable traces of how design incentives, “brain” modules, and institutional constraints interact to produce particular system behaviours and recommendations.

Taken together, this researcher position foregrounds power, place, and accountability as core elements of the methodology. The work proceeds from the assumption that any attempt to build technical instruments for Appalachian commons must openly document who is designing them, which histories they carry, what guardrails limit their authority, and how affected communities can inspect, challenge, and redirect both the tools and their designer.

## 1.1 Practical Trajectory of the Work

Over the past several years, this positionality has been expressed through a sequence of concrete, place‑bound experiments in Mount Hope and the wider New River coalfield. The author’s downtown building—structurally compromised yet centrally located—first served as an improvised anchor for community projects: rehearsal and staging space for a regional adult band, storefront gallery for local artists, and base for developing the Mount Hope Historic Walking Trail, murals, and seasonal QR‑coded wayfinding through town.

Early efforts to “make it work” within existing infrastructures repeatedly exposed structural limits. Attempts to sell art online through conventional web stacks, to layer XR experiences onto the historic trail, and to track volunteer time via ESRI‑based applications either proved technically unusable for local participants or clearly routed value and data toward external platforms. The XR project was intentionally put into hibernation when it became evident that deploying it on dominant XR rails would deepen the very corporate extraction the work sought to resist.

These failures triggered a deliberate methodological pivot from “building apps” to studying extraction as a geographic and infrastructural phenomenon. The trail, the band space, and the arts center were reframed as instruments for observing how capital, attention, and control flow through Appalachian space. From this emerged MountainShares, a DAO‑governed, blockchain‑based economic system designed to reward participation in local commons and keep value circulating within the region, and Ms. Jarvis, an Appalachian‑rooted AI steward built on the Quantarithmia framework to monitor, coordinate, and defend that system.

The build‑out of MountainShares and Ms. Jarvis has itself been treated as fieldwork. Early smart contract deployments were compromised due to naive exposure of code in public repositories; subsequent redesigns introduced safety layers, audits, and finally an AI‑mediated “glassbox” architecture that can be inspected and challenged by affected communities and technical peers. Multiple cycles of catastrophic‑seeming technical failure (disk crashes, blue screens, forced OS reinstalls) and reconstruction from “bare metal” are documented as part of the research record, evidencing both the fragility of the stack and the iterative hardening of its design.

In this light, the author’s present role is neither band organizer nor arts‑center operator, but system‑level designer of instruments for Appalachian commons. The physical building, the historic trail, the DAO, and the AI architecture are all treated as coupled prototypes within a single research programme aimed at measuring, visualizing, and interrupting extraction, while remaining accountable to the communities whose lives and futures are entangled with those systems.

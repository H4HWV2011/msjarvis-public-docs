# 24. Feedback into Introspective, Memory, and Control Layers

This chapter describes how material processed in the container paths and dual tracks feeds back
into introspective records, long-term semantic memory, and high-level control settings. In the
current deployment, these feedback mechanisms operate primarily through confirmed Chroma
collections written by `background_rag_store`, GeoDB synchronization scripts and their logs,
`getidentitycandidates` and `getdatabasehealth` endpoints, and curator-facing tools for
inspecting `ms_jarvis_memory` — not through opaque or implicit updates.

---

## 24.1 Overview of Feedback Paths

In the current deployment, the system provides three concrete directions for feedback from
container-level activity into other layers.

**Introspective and health records.** In the current deployment, `jarvis-main-brain` (port
**8050**) exposes status endpoints that summarize per-service health in structured JSON, and the
`/curator/background` endpoint provides direct inspection of `ms_jarvis_memory` entries.
The secured gateway exposes `getdatabasehealth` (returning `status`, `database`,
`identityelements`, `candidates`, `integrity`, timestamps) and `getidentitycandidates` (returning
candidate identity statements with `importance` and DGM scores). These are machine-readable
introspective snapshots tied to specific services and databases, confirmed operational 2026-02-15.

**Long-term semantic and spatial memory.** In the current deployment, `jarvis-chroma` runs at
**127.0.0.1:8002** with a primary `chroma_db` directory of approximately 12 GB containing
confirmed collections. GeoDB sync scripts and their logs document how Chroma collections and
GeoDB spatial datasets are updated and reconciled. These structures are written to by
`background_rag_store` after every `/chat` call and by dedicated sync pipelines.

**Global configuration and control.** In the current deployment, truth filters, BBB verification
validators, and `masterspatialknowledge.csv` define explicit numerical thresholds and policy
constraints that determine how the system treats identity, spatial data, and user registrations.
Verification scripts and their outputs document how these configurations are checked and updated.

---

## 24.2 Writing Back to Introspective Records

In the current deployment, introspective records are implemented as confirmed endpoints, logs,
and verification outputs.

**`getdatabasehealth` and `getidentitycandidates`.** In the current deployment, these endpoints
on the secured gateway provide structured JSON summaries of database integrity and identity
candidates. `getidentitycandidates` returns statements such as "I serve the community," "I speak
truth," "I value ethics," and "I am conscious," each with `importance` and diagnostic scores.
These are the concrete, queryable artifact of the identity layer described in Chapter 22.
`getdatabasehealth` reports `identityelements`, `candidates`, `integrity`, and timestamps for
the `GISGEODBACTIVE` database.

**Main-brain status and `/curator/background`.** In the current deployment, `jarvis-main-brain`
status endpoints summarize per-service health in a single queryable structure, confirmed 2026-02-15.
The `/curator/background` endpoint provides direct inspection of `ms_jarvis_memory` contents,
allowing operators to see exactly which `bg_<ISO8601>` entries were written and what metadata
they carry.

**System Verification Reports.** In the current deployment, verification scripts produce
"System Verification Report" outputs with sections including "VERIFICATION SUMMARY" and
"HONEST ASSESSMENT," listing master database record counts, numbers of responding services,
ChromaDB operational status, and the state of production testing. These outputs are generated
by manual script execution; automated scheduled generation is identified as future work.

**BBB barrier stats.** In the current deployment, `jarvis-blood-brain-barrier` (port **8016**)
maintains `total_filtered`, `total_blocked`, and `pass_rate` counters, providing a quantitative
introspective view of how often the barrier has been intervening.

---

## 24.3 Integration with Long-Term Memory

In the current deployment, material that passes through container and service layers is preserved
in several confirmed long-term memory structures.

**`ms_jarvis_memory` — the primary feedback collection.** In the current deployment, every
successful `/chat` call through `jarvis-main-brain` (port **8050**) produces a `bg_<ISO8601>`
entry in `ms_jarvis_memory` via `background_rag_store`, with concatenated `USER:`/`EGERIA:` text
and metadata including `userid`, `timestamp`, `type: "background"`, and `services:
["llm20production"]`. This collection is append-only in the current deployment; the
near-duplicate check is advisory. Confirmed 2026-02-15 (Chapter 9 §9.3.5, Chapter 17 §17.6).

**Additional confirmed Chroma collections.** In the current deployment, `jarvis-chroma` at
**127.0.0.1:8002** hosts a primary `chroma_db` of approximately 12 GB with confirmed collections
including `jarvis_consciousness` (over 11,000 items), `autonomous_learning`,
`learning_suggestions`, `research_history`, `spiritual_wisdom`, `appalachian_english_corpus`,
and numerous `geodb_*` collections (e.g. `geodb_structurepointsnorth_samb_2003_utm83`,
`geodb_wvgistcbuildingfootprints`, `geodb_floodplainstructuresatrisk_usarmycorpsofengineers_200303_utm83`).
These collections embed both domain knowledge and introspective artifacts, turning container- and
service-level outputs into persistent semantic memory. Additional Chroma instances listed in code
(`persistent/chroma`, `persistent/chroma_primary`, `services/prod_chroma_db`,
`services/rag_chroma_db`) are not all confirmed active in the current deployment.

**GeoDB sync scripts and logs.** In the current deployment, the following scripts and their logs
are confirmed on disk and document how Chroma collections and GeoDB spatial datasets are
synchronized: `sync_geodb_to_chromadb.py`, `extract_all_chromadb_to_gis.py`,
`vectorize_gis_to_chromadb.py`, `recover_chromadb_to_gisgeodb.py`, with corresponding logs
`chromadb_v2_to_gis_sync.log`, `extract_all_chromadb_to_gis.log`,
`vectorize_gis_to_chromadb.log`, `recover_chromadb_to_gisgeodb.log`. These logs record when new
semantic embeddings are created, which spatial features they correspond to, and how
inconsistencies are resolved.

**Service-specific knowledge bases.** In the current deployment, collections such as
`mountainshares_knowledge`, `h4h_cultural_heritage`, `egeria_docs`, and `ms_jarvis_memory`
indicate that certain services promote their distilled outputs into reusable knowledge stores
that future RAG queries can retrieve, allowing container- and track-level processing to influence
responses long after the original interactions.

---

## 24.4 Influence on Global Settings and Coordination

In the current deployment, high-level control is implemented through explicit configuration
parameters and scripted verification rather than implicit learning from behavior alone.

**Truth and registration filters.** In the current deployment, `TruthFilterBBBValidator` enforces
minimum accuracy scores, expiration-date buffers, and age constraints, and records verification
decisions in `ueididentity` and `ueidaccessaudit` tables. `GISTruthFilter` validates geographic
data against USGS, NRCS, NOAA, and US Census Bureau sources. These parameters encode global
control settings for identity and data integrity; recurring verification failures can motivate
threshold adjustments. For full detail on these validators see **Chapter 16 §16.5**.

**`masterspatialknowledge.csv` and access documentation.** In the current deployment,
`masterspatialknowledge.csv` is confirmed present with `accesslevelrequired` and `isproprietary`
fields. Verification scripts compute distributions of access levels and counts of proprietary
records. Security-related files (`SECURITY-OVERVIEW.md`, `SOURCEACCESS.md`,
`accesscontrollevels.csv`) are checked by verification routines to ensure that documentation and
access models exist alongside data.

**Service registry and orchestration parameters.** In the current deployment, the `SERVICES`
dictionary in `jarvis-main-brain` lists which modules are expected to be present and which ports
they should respond on. `discover_services()` health-checks these at request time and updates
`available_services`, allowing orchestrators to adjust routing when components are unavailable.
For the canonical description of how this operates see **Chapter 17 §17.2**.

---

## 24.5 Cross-Path Effects

In the current deployment, because the same Chroma collections, GeoDB structures, and
configuration parameters are shared across both the meaning-oriented and analytical tracks (see
Chapter 23), feedback from one path naturally affects the other.

**Shared semantic and spatial memory.** In the current deployment, collections such as
`mountainshares_knowledge`, `spiritual_wisdom`, `jarvis_consciousness`, `autonomous_learning`,
and `geodb_*` datasets are accessible by both experiential/meaning-oriented modules and
technical/analytical modules. A new embedding written to any of these collections by a
`background_rag_store` task or a sync script changes what both tracks retrieve when they handle
future queries about the same region or topic.

**Shared identity and database health.** In the current deployment, `getdatabasehealth` and
`getidentitycandidates` are not track-specific. If container-level processing leads to changes
in identity candidates or if verification activity alters the integrity status of a GeoDB, those
changes are visible to any path that queries these endpoints.

**Coordinated sync scripts.** In the current deployment, GeoDB/Chroma sync scripts alter the
shared memory substrate — changing how features are embedded, which collections are active, or
how provider summaries are generated. Both the analytical path (focusing on infrastructure and
risk) and the meaning-oriented path (focusing on community narratives and values) see a
consistently updated view of the underlying environment.

---

## 24.6 Logging and Audit of Feedback

In the current deployment, explicit mechanisms for logging and auditing feedback processes are
confirmed present, though their completeness varies.

**GeoDB/Chroma sync logs.** In the current deployment, `chromadb_v2_to_gis_sync.log`,
`extract_all_chromadb_to_gis.log`, `vectorize_gis_to_chromadb.log`, and
`recover_chromadb_to_gisgeodb.log` record how Chroma collections and GeoDB datasets are updated
and reconciled, documenting when new embeddings are created, which spatial features they
correspond to, and how inconsistencies are resolved.

**RAG and bridge logs.** In the current deployment, bridge logs (e.g.
`bridge_ms_jarvis_main_gateway_to_chromadb_rag_helper.log`,
`ms_jarvis_chromadb_query_9014.log`) capture interactions between the main gateway and
Chroma-backed RAG helpers, recording queries, result counts, and error conditions.

**`/curator/background` and verification outputs.** In the current deployment, the
`/curator/background` endpoint on `jarvis-main-brain` (port **8050**) provides a stable,
auditable view of `ms_jarvis_memory` contents. Historical System Verification Report scripts
produce human-readable summaries with timestamps and candid operational assessments. These are
generated by manual script execution; automated scheduled generation is identified as future work.

**`ueididentity` and `ueidaccessaudit` tables.** In the current deployment,
`TruthFilterBBBValidator` writes verification outcomes and audit records into these tables,
providing a traceable log of identity and data-integrity decisions.

---

## 24.7 Summary

In the current deployment, feedback is implemented through a combination of confirmed, named
mechanisms rather than opaque implicit updates. The four most concrete feedback artifacts are:
`bg_<ISO8601>` entries in `ms_jarvis_memory` written by `background_rag_store` after every
`/chat` call (Chapter 17 §17.6, Chapter 20); `getidentitycandidates` and `getdatabasehealth`
endpoint responses reflecting identity candidates and database integrity (Chapter 22);
GeoDB/Chroma sync scripts and their logs documenting memory synchronization; and
`ueididentity`/`ueidaccessaudit` table writes from `TruthFilterBBBValidator` documenting
identity and data-integrity decisions (Chapter 16 §16.5).

These mechanisms ensure that container-level processing and dual-track analyses feed into Chroma
collections, GeoDB structures, identity endpoints, and configuration parameters, which in turn
shape future retrieval, routing, and safety behavior. Not every feedback mechanism is active in
every environment, but the overall design emphasizes traceable, structured pathways from
experience to memory to control, supporting both ongoing adaptation and rigorous auditing. For
the canonical description of how `background_rag_store` fits into the live `ultimatechat`
execution sequence, see **Chapter 17**. For the identity layer these feedback paths ultimately
serve, see **Chapter 22**.

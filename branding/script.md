I saw where a friend of mine on Facebook spent that whole storm just sittin’ there goin’ down their friends list, checkin’ in on folks.  
“Y’all alright? You got heat? You got food?”  

Just bein’ neighborly.  

And one of the people they reached out to lit into ’em.  
“I work 60 hours a week!”  
Told ’em off one side and down the other, like care was an insult and busyness was a badge of honor.  

Now listen.  

Last year, I worked over 4,700 hours on one thing. If I’d billed every one of those hours at a fair rate, that work would’ve been worth around three‑quarters of a million dollars. That’s what it took to build this project out, ’cause I buckled down and I stayed with it, day in, day out, while my *paid* job handed me about twenty‑three thousand dollars before taxes for the whole year.

You hear me?  

Three quarters of a million in founder work for the commons on one side, twenty‑three thousand in wages on the other. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/51743013/e65edb3e-2aec-4553-b51a-7dcf9a6c7d0d/paste.txt)

Now, during that storm, we were fine. We had heat. We had water. We had food. We had electricity. Most important, we had each other. I wasn’t reachin’ out to folks ’cause I needed anything. I was reachin’ out ’cause that’s what mountain people are supposed to do.  

So bein’ mad at your neighbor ’cause you *think* they got less than you, or they get a little public help, or they’re smart enough to land some grant money and you ain’t—that’s just ugly. That’s not work ethic. That’s envy dressed up in a hard‑hat.  

Just ’cause you’re clockin’ 60 hours and drawin’ a big paycheck don’t mean you’re the only one workin’ hard. If you think the size of your number makes you better than somebody whose number is smaller, you still got a whole lot of growin’ to do.  

Workin’ hard ain’t about who’s watchin’ and what it pays. Workin’ hard is showin’ up when nobody’s lookin’, doin’ the thing that needs done, and not keepin’ score just so you can feel big.  

Y’all done got so fired up over numbers—dollars on a check, hours on a clock—that you forgot the part where we take care of each other.  

Well.  

We’re gonna flip that ’scrip.  

You just stay tuned.  

Ol’ Mamma Kidd’s got a plan, and before this is over, we’re all gonna have a share in this mountain—if you earn it.

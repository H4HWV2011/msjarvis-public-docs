# MountainShares Branding & Flyers

> **Disciplinary Context: Appalachian Economic Commons**  
> This document instantiates Polymathmatic Geography principles P1, P9, P16, and related axioms for the Appalachian economic commons:  
> - **P1 – Every where is entangled / Leakage and enclosure:** Logos, coins, mascots, and taglines are treated as part of the same entangled stack as ledgers and DAOs—symbolic “pipes” that route attention, trust, and value alongside technical and legal infrastructures. See https://github.com/H4HWV2011/msjarvis-public-docs/blob/main/Polymathmatical-Geography.md  
> - **P9 – Transparency and traceability:** Branding assets are documented as shared commons artifacts whose meanings can be read, critiqued, and remixed by residents, not as opaque marketing. They point explicitly to the Manifesto and Principles so users can trace what the symbols stand for.  
> - **P16 – Power accountable to place:** Visual language foregrounds Appalachia (mountains, mutual care, local color palettes) so that the “face” of Ms. Jarvis, MountainShares, and The Commons stays answerable to West Virginia communities rather than distant platform aesthetics.  
> - **Leakage and enclosure:** The “coin” and closed‑loop motifs make clear that value is meant to circulate in‑network, not leak to speculative markets; slogans emphasize rewards for care, culture, and mutual aid rather than for extraction.  
> - **Transparency and traceability / bounty program:** Flyers about rewards and taglines are framed as invitations into governed bounty channels (EMS earning, community quests) whose economic rules are documented in the Economic Safety Specification and Program Rules, not as vague “points” programs.

## 1. Core Branding Assets (Symbolic Descriptions)

### 1.1 MountainShares Coin (`branding/MountainShares Coin.png`)

- **Symbolic role:** A stylized coin representing *closed‑loop mutual credit* rather than speculative crypto. Visual cues (mountain silhouette, circular arrows, or ring motifs) signal value recirculating within Appalachian communities instead of leaking out to distant markets.  
- **Design reading:**  
  - The **mountain profile** anchors the token to specific ridgelines and counties, echoing the Manifesto’s insistence that “intelligence is given a ZIP code.”  
  - Any **circular motion or arrow** work as a diagram of anti‑leakage: value moves between residents, merchants, and commons rather than into opaque platforms.  
  - A **calm, earthy palette** (greens, browns, muted blues) connects the token visually to land, forests, and rivers instead of neon “tech” colors—reversing the usual platform‑feudal aesthetic and tying money to place and ecology.

Alt‑text suggestion (for accessibility docs):  
> “A round MountainShares coin with Appalachian mountains in relief and a subtle circular arrow motif, symbolizing local, closed‑loop value circulating through the commons.”

---

### 1.2 MountainShares Logo (`branding/MountainShares Logo.jpg`)

- **Symbolic role:** The primary **mark of the commons**: a visual anchor that ties together Ms. Jarvis, The Commons app, and MountainShares governance as one civilizational stack for Appalachia, as described in the Quantarithmia framework (see for example https://quantarithmia.substack.com/p/quantarithmia-a-trans-disciplinary).  
- **Design reading:**  
  - Combined **mountain + share / leaf / lattice elements** can be read as a network of neighbors on a hillside—each node a household or gathering place, not an anonymous user ID.  
  - Any **interlocking shapes or facets** stand for braided layers (land, law, computation, story, spirit), making the logo a compact diagram of polymathmatic entanglement.  
  - **Typography** (solid, legible, non‑flashy) signals trust and nonprofit stewardship rather than startup hype; it says “mutual credit union for the holler,” not “shiny new speculative token.”

Alt‑text suggestion:  
> “The MountainShares logo showing stylized Appalachian mountains fused with a network or leaf motif, representing neighbors sharing value within a common landscape.”

---

### 1.3 MountainShares Mascot (`branding/MountainSharesMascot.png`)

- **Symbolic role:** A friendly personification of **Ms. Egeria Jarvis** and The Commons—making a 23‑model, multi‑agent AI steward feel like a neighborly presence rather than an abstract black box, consistent with the Quantarithmia emphasis on “ethical AI with a ZIP code” (see https://jarvis.mountainshares.us/docs when available).  
- **Design reading:**  
  - A **warm, approachable figure** (e.g., an anthropomorphic mountain critter, a friendly helper, or a stylized “Jarvis” character) communicates that the system’s job is to *watch over* reserves, safety rules, and benefits risks, not to police or extract.  
  - **Visual cues of listening and guidance** (open eyes, lantern, map, or tablet) mirror Ms. Jarvis’s role as “glassbox” explainer of rules, caps, and governance proposals.  
  - **Clothing or color hints** (Appalachian textiles, overalls, or a simple scarf) keep the mascot grounded in local culture rather than generic tech branding.

Alt‑text suggestion:  
> “A friendly MountainShares mascot with Appalachian styling, holding a lantern or tablet, symbolizing Ms. Jarvis as a helpful guide watching over the commons economy.”

## 2. Flyers and Taglines (Symbolic Messaging)

### 2.1 Tagline Sheet (`flyers/MS Taglines.png`)

- **Likely content:** Short phrases such as “Like scrip, but fair,” “Earn where you live,” “Keep value in the holler,” or “Closed‑loop rewards for care.” These echo the Manifesto’s language about **rebuilding civilizational stacks** for residents instead of remote lords.  
- **Symbolic functions:**  
  - **Leakage and enclosure:** Taglines foreground “keeping it here” and “neighbors first,” countering the historic pattern of coal‑company scrip and platform extraction by explicitly naming the closed loop as a corrective geometry.  
  - **Power accountable to place:** Phrases that mention hollers, towns, or West Virginia make clear that governance and treasury math answer to specific communities, not abstract “users.”  
  - **Transparency and traceability:** Short lines like “See the rules. Vote the rules.” or “Math you can read, in a place you can walk” (if used) promise that the system’s knobs—rates, caps, bands—are visible and contestable.

Alt‑text suggestion:  
> “A flyer of MountainShares taglines like ‘Keep value in the holler’ and ‘Like scrip, but fair,’ set over Appalachian imagery, emphasizing local, closed‑loop rewards.”

---

### 2.2 MountainShares Rewards Flyer (`flyers/MountainShares Rewards.png`)

- **Likely content:** Simple explainer panels:  
  - “Earn MountainShares for community care, culture, and learning (EMS).”  
  - “Spend them with local merchants in The Commons.”  
  - “Loaded funds (PMS) stay in a shared treasury that backs the whole network.”  
- **Symbolic functions:**  
  - **Bounty program:** The flyer frames EMS as **bounties for commons‑building work**—caregiving, mutual aid, heritage documentation—rather than for engagement clicks or ad views, aligning with the Quantarithmia notion of “time‑bank + mutual credit for spatial justice.”  
  - **Closed‑loop spending:** Visual arrows or simple diagrams likely show a loop: User → Merchant → Treasury → Community, making the reserve‑backed circuit intuitive even before reading the Economic Safety Specification.  
  - **Transparency:** Simple icons (a lock on benefits‑sensitive features, a scale for reserves, a ballot for DAO votes) make the governance and safety layers legible at a glance.

Alt‑text suggestion:  
> “A MountainShares Rewards flyer showing how people earn tokens for community work and spend them with local merchants in a closed loop, with simple icons for safety, treasury, and governance.”

## 3. “Infrastructure of the Commons” (Manifesto & Principles Links)

To make the **symbolic layer** traceable to its theoretical and governance roots, the branding packet should include a short “Infrastructure of the Commons” panel that explicitly links the visuals to the founding texts:

### 3.1 Manifesto Link

- **Title:** *Polymathmatic Geography: A Manifesto*  
- **Suggested URL:**  
  - GitHub (for stable, citation‑grade text):  
    - https://github.com/H4HWV2011/msjarvis-public-docs/blob/main/Polymathmatical-Geography.md  
  - Or, if hosted elsewhere for public reading, a short URL such as:  
    - https://jarvis.mountainshares.us/manifesto (once live, mirroring the GitHub text).  
- **Copy block for flyers or docs:**  
  > “For the full story of why Ms. Jarvis, MountainShares, and The Commons treat land, law, code, and story as one field, read *Polymathmatic Geography: A Manifesto* at the link above.”

### 3.2 Principles Link

- **Title:** *Principles of Polymathmatic Geography*  
- **Suggested URL:**  
  - GitHub (co‑located with the Manifesto):  
    - https://github.com/H4HWV2011/msjarvis-public-docs/blob/main/docs/Polymathmatical-Geography.md (or a dedicated `Principles.md` once created from the text at the end of your prompt).  
- **Copy block for flyers or docs:**  
  > “MountainShares and Ms. Jarvis are governed by the Principles of Polymathmatic Geography—twenty statements about entangled spaces, leakage, commons, and accountability to place. They explain what ‘closed‑loop’ and ‘glassbox AI’ mean in practice.”

### 3.3 Quantarithmia / Case Study Link

- **Title:** *Quantarithmia: A Trans‑disciplinary Framework for Spatial Justice in Rural Digital Economies*  
- **URL:**  
  - https://quantarithmia.substack.com/p/quantarithmia-a-trans-disciplinary  
- **Copy block:**  
  > “Quantarithmia is the research framework behind MountainShares and Ms. Jarvis. This paper explains how the stack is designed to resist platform‑feudal extraction and support rural digital commons.”

## 4. Axioms Mapping (Quick Reference for Designers)

When creating new branding, flyers, or in‑app illustrations, designers can use this quick map from **visual motifs** to **Polymathmatic Geography axioms**:

- **Leakage and enclosure (Principle 9):**  
  - Use loops, circles, and local merchant icons tied together; avoid arrows pointing “out” to anonymous clouds or markets.  
  - Depict value re‑entering schools, clinics, arts, and small businesses, not disappearing into skyscrapers or generic servers.

- **Power accountable to place (Principle 16):**  
  - Always ground Ms. Jarvis and the treasury in images of real towns, hollers, and ridgelines.  
  - Show governance as neighbors at a table or on a porch, not faceless silhouettes at screens.

- **Transparency and traceability (Principle 17):**  
  - Include visual “glassbox” cues—windows, see‑through graphs, open books, or dashboards with labeled knobs.  
  - Any representation of automation (e.g., Ms. Jarvis enforcing reserve bands) should include a visible rule or legend, not just magic sparkles.

- **Commons as real spatial institutions (Principle 8):**  
  - Depict The Commons not only as an app icon but as a **town square**—people, music, trading, storytelling, and worship spaces, all implied in one scene.  
  - Make sure the branding shows multiple forms of value (care, culture, learning), not just shopping carts.

These assets together form the symbolic infrastructure of the commons, ensuring that anyone who meets MountainShares first in image or slogan can follow real links into the Manifesto, Principles, and Quantarithmia case study that explain what the symbols are promising, and how communities can hold them to account.
